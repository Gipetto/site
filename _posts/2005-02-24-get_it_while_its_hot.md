[The newest scoop on the Lion, The Witch & the Wardrobe](http://bvbp-qt.vitalstream.com/LionWitchWardrobe/Narnia_Chapter2_TheDirector_1500.mov).

I really can't wait to see this especially since WETA is doing the costumes. In case you don't know, WETA did the makeup and characters for the Lord of the Rings trilogy.

I would be a nice guy and mirror this but the damn thing is 33mb and I just can't foot that kind of bandwidth.

On a similar note: [An interview](http://www.countingdown.com/movies/1463/news?item_id=3659831) with the movie's visual effects supervisor.
