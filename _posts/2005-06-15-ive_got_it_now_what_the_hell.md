So, I traded and older 802.11b router for a new 8port 10/100 switch (thanks, Alden) and now I should probably get around to moving the server into the basement.

I need the switch because my 4 port router is almost out of ports and also I need to get 2 devices attached through the basement and I only want to have the 1 hole in the office floor.

I now get to decide how I want to handle the wiring and figure out where I'm gonna get power for the switch in the basement. The central location I'd like to put it doesn't have nearby power so I'll probably end up doubling back over some cable runs to get everything wired in. No biggie, I guess. Cable's not that expensive and the distances won't cause any kind of signal issues so I really just have to stop whining and get it doneâ€¦

whine, whine, whine. Ok, I'm done now.
