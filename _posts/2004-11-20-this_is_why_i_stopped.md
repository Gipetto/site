I stopped doing freelance work for a while because I didn't have time for my own endeavors. Now I've picked up a yearly project that I like to do. Or that I used to like to do.

I think now that I'm making good money at work and that I have a wife, home and two dogs that I want to have time for other things now that money is not a burning need.

So why did I do it again if all I do is complain about how much work has to be done and how the photographer is a moron and underexposed everything and didn't take any color balance into account when shooting?

Who knows. I think deep down I still like making that extra money because now it becomes play money instead of grocery money.

This particular job doesn't serve to teach me anything new but there is one that does. One that I've been putting off. It is one that could possibly make money for just outputting clean code and having good organization. But I have been dragging my feet on it. I think I'm scared a little on how much commitment it will take.

I'm having fun with the Gippy Pages, even if the design is average and the code is sometimes awkward – I'm learning a lot with it and I'm enjoying it being the only thing that I'm doing outside of work.

I should probably do that other job – it would only take a weekend to completely pump out a functioning framework and then another week to tweak design and layout. And it could possibly yield some recurring income, but I still drag my feet on it.

I don't know why, and now I feel like I'm rambling.

I guess I should shut up and get back to work.
