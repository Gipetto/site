I so badly want to start using some of the [new features in PHP 5.2](http://www.php.net/releases/5_2_0.php) but don't want to get too far into it before our web host at work makes the switch. After all, they're still on PHP 5.1.1.

With so many neat additions to the language its hard to resist, but I don't want to start using new features before I can implement them. Gah! I'm smack dab in the middle of building a framework that will (hopefully) carry me and be extensible for a long time and I'd sure love to get these features in at the ground level.

Guess its time to shoot the web host an email…
