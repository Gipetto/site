Just ran across a fun little tidbit about Internet Explorer on Windows.

You can force a Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) by typing "about:mozilla" in the address bar. 

If you're running XP SP2 that won't work, you'll have to do "es://mshtml.dll/about.moz"

Just the thing to torture others in your office.
