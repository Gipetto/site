Hawai'i is absolutely beautiful. And we haven't even really left the Waikiki area yet except to do a seaplane ride (which was fabulous). This place is a total tourist trap but the water and weather are wonderful.

Here are a couple of pics so far:

Tomorrow we're up Diamondhead and out to view some dolphins. On Monday we're renting a car and heading up to the north shore and Huanama Bay (I think I spelled that right, maybe).

I think we're gonna have to look into moving hereâ€¦
