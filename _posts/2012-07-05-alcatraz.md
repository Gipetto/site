Some friends came in from out of town and we ended up doing some tourist-like stuff. Unfortunately I was hacking up a lung so I was kinda just slothing around, but I was able to squeak out a few decent shots.

Birds are abundant on the island and I caught this one is just about the perfect spot. It only would have been better if he were facing me.

The buildings are in need of some upkeep which makes them very interesting to look at. Every piece of chipped paint, rust and bird poop helps create interesting textures.

Amazingly enough I had the whole recreation yard to myself to get a nice hero shot of the main cellhouse.

Unfortunately now age is starting to get the best of me and I need to get the diopter settings straightened out because I'm noticing that my efforts to manually focus are meeting with less and less success. I don't mind getting older but couldn't it be nice and effect some other part of my body? Oh, wait, it already isâ€¦
