No, not tonsil hockey.

We bought a 14 game package to the Colorado Avalanche and so far have been to 2 winning games. Unfortunately the first one was preseason so it was refreshing to see this latest win against the Canuck-leheads after a couple of ties against Dallas and Minnesota.

I took the little Nikon camera with me this time just for fun.

I'm actually still getting used to all the new names. Not just on the Avs, but on the opposition as well. But I can get used to Luongo being a Canuck – he couldn't win against the Avs when he was in Florida – lets hope that carries through the season in Vancouver as well.
