So today marked 6 years of being married. Holy hell where does the time go? Just yesterday we were scraping by in a 500 square foot apartment in Canon City and now we're doing well, have a house and a couple of furry kids.

10 years ago, when I met this crazy lady, I never would have imagined we would have carved out a life this good together. Just goes to show that you never can predict what your life is gonna be like â€“ it just kinda happens.
