I noticed a snafu with the links in the RSS feed this morning. I forgot to update the links in the RSS feed when I changed domains so when a link was followed to read the full story the user was not presented with the full story.

That has now been fixed. If a story felt incomplete recently you might try looking at it again â€“ there just might be more to it ðŸ˜‰
