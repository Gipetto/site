I've added partial function definitions to the [WordPress TextMate Bundle](/projects/wordpress-textmate-bundle/). The tool-tips list the function definition as well as the file and line number where the function is defined so that the full function definition can be looked up easily.

<div class="frame">
  <img src="https://i2.wp.com/top-frog.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/wp-tmbundle-tool-tip.png?resize=500%2C78" alt="wp-tmbundle-tool-tip" title="wp-tmbundle-tool-tip" width="500" height="78" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1024" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/top-frog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/wp-tmbundle-tool-tip.png?w=500&ssl=1 500w, https://i2.wp.com/top-frog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/wp-tmbundle-tool-tip.png?resize=75%2C11&ssl=1 75w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" data-recalc-dims="1" />
</div>

The function definitions can be brought up by selecting or setting the carat inside the function that needs to be defined and then using `Command-Shift-H` to bring up the tool tip.

I don't list full definitions (ie: the textual definition that accompanies the functions in DocBlocks) mainly because I haven't worked out the best way to parse the WordPress source tree to get those. I'm sure there's a way, it just hasn't been high priority yet.

Oh, yeah, and [I like donuts!](/donate/) ðŸ˜‰
