I've added partial function definitions to the [WordPress TextMate Bundle](/projects/wordpress-textmate-bundle/). The tool-tips list the function definition as well as the file and line number where the function is defined so that the full function definition can be looked up easily.

<span class="frame">
  <img src="/assets/articles/wp-tmbundle-tool-tip.png" alt="WordPress TextMate Bundle Screenshot" aria-hidden="true" />
</span>

The function definitions can be brought up by selecting or setting the carat inside the function that needs to be defined and then using `Command-Shift-H` to bring up the tool tip.

I don't list full definitions (ie: the textual definition that accompanies the functions in DocBlocks) mainly because I haven't worked out the best way to parse the WordPress source tree to get those. I'm sure there's a way, it just hasn't been high priority yet.

Oh, yeah, and [I like donuts!](/donate/) ðŸ˜‰
