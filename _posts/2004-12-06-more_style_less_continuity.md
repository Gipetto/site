Found a neat scalable box technique the other day and thought I'd give it a whirl. So, now I have a bit more graphic appeal but still no unified vision.

I really need to sit down and figure out a design for this site.

I dig these boxes, but now the navigation seems like it should be different than these boxes and that I should have a header – basically, if I'm gonna get all graphical & shiznit on this main body then I'd best pick up everything to match and dump the minimalism.

It just takes me so damn long to design for myself…

On top of that I need to get my date system for these posts fixed. Like an idiot I made it with a separate field for date and time – compeletely ignoring the mySQL datetime option. I'm such a moron.
