> &#8220;And I frankly would be very worried if somebody assured me that nothing in their faiths would affect their judgments because then I wonder, how can you have judgment if you have no faith, and how can I trust you with power if you donâ€™t pray? The notion that you are endowed by your Creator sets a certain boundary on what we mean by &#8216;America,'&#8221;

That quote is from Newt Gingrich.

And, according to Newt, the adulterer, I can't be trusted and he can, and that somehow I'm not American? This is everything that is wrong with religion in politics and this is exactly why I don't want religion driving the decisions of my legislators. Despite religions teachings (any religion) its turned on its ear by anyone on a stump, contorted to drive a wedge between those who don't follow the same version of God.

Its not that freedom of religion is under attack in America. Its just that we're sick of it being used as a tool to gain power. No matter who you pray to you need to open your eyes and question any time someone uses God as a means of convincing you of anything, because more often than not the outcome is not in your best interest. Only theirs.

Its election season. Which means that its also snake oil season. Be careful in what others want you to believe.
