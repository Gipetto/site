So, I'm constantly switching between using an external monitor and the built in display on my MacBook Pro. The only application that doesn't seem to like this is iTunes. Whenever I unplug the monitor iTunes most of the time won't adjust. 

The little green &#8220;resize window&#8221; button is of no use in iTunes because it toggles the mini-player. Or so I thought. 

If I option-click that little green button in the title bar, whatever that little guy is called, the window will resize to within the display bounds so that you can grab the corners again.

No more changing the screen resolution just to fix the iTunes window. I can't believe that it took me so long to get this.
