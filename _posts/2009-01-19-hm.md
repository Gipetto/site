Man, how long has it been? Too long. 

I really should pull myself away and write some more. Its just that I've been spending so much time inside WordPress lately I haven't had much time to spend on my own framework which I was hoping to port this blog to. That might have gotten more attention if I had been writing more… 

Or, I could turn this in to a "What I learned about WordPress today" blog which I'm sure I could gather a lot of traffic with. We're doing some wonderful WP hacking around here and I've managed to get WP doing things that I didn't think it could do (authenticated file access, anybody?).

Anyway. Here's hoping I can get more writing in this year. I'm not one much for making new year's resolutions but I really should aim to create more content than I consume this year. That will entail writing more and I like that. Even if I have bad writing skills… its still therapeutic.
