**Today marked my last day of chemo treatment for this shitty ol' cancer.**

While I want to celebrate with reckless abandon I'm not over the hump just yet. In 4 weeks I go in for new scans to see if the chemo did its job. If it didn't there's surgery in my future. My diagnosis on the type of cancer was pure Seminoma and that is encouraging since the pure Seminioma typically responds well to chemo, so I'm hopeful, but I don't want to call it a sure thing and get let down.

But, for now, I'm content in knowing that for a while, at least, I can coast and just try to feel better. 

I'm now starting to look forward at my return to work. I'm still not sure what return date is appropriate. I have one tentatively set but I'm not sure I'll be ready by then. That date is about 4 weeks away, but now that I know how I felt after having 3 weeks off (not great) I'm wondering if that's enough to be fair to me and to work. I'm eager to get back to work but my brain and body are lagging something fierce. My brain has no capacity and my body no energy.

I guess I'll have to see how long I can fairly string out that decision.
