I was having one of those never ending text editor comparison conversations at work the other day and learned that BBEdit has some pretty easy to format Clipping functionality. Since I had pretty much built a generic function parser for yanking the information that I needed out of the WordPress source files for the [WordPress TextMate Bundle](http://top-frog.com/projects/wordpress-textmate-bundle/) I figured it shouldn't be too hard to create a set of Clippings for BBEdit.

[Turns out I was right](http://top-frog.com/projects/wordpress-clippings-for-bbedit/). They're not as glamorous as the TextMate bundle, but they're better than what was there before.
