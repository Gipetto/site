Well after 4 hours and damn near putting my head through the wall: I have an RSS feed.

It didn't take me long to actually build the file and get it to validate – it was a testing snafu that took me a while to figure out. It seems that my RSS aggregator on this site will not load a local RSS file. Figuring that out was 3 of the 4 hours that made up adding the feed to the site.

So now Joel and anyone else bored out of their skulls can get the daily update on this site.

It is plain ol RSS 2 without any of the bells and whistles – mainly because RSS is simple, so why futz it up with all this extra crap that few people actually use anyway.

Get it while it's hot: [RSS](/rss)

On a side note – while doing the testing on this I loaded up the [Sage](http://sage.mozdev.org) RSS reader for [FireFox](http://www.mozilla.org/firefox). Damn – that's pretty nice. Too bad FireFox looks bad on the Mac. The font rendering just doesn't cut it and I don't like the look of form feilds – they lack contrast and are hard to find quickly. But still – Sage was stinkin' cool.
