The [Post Password Plugin](http://top-frog.com/projects/post-password-token/) plugin for WordPress has been updated to version 1.1. This new version adds a feature to hide all password protected posts from anything but direct access. With this option enabled password protected posts will not be pulled from the database unless the post is accessed directly. This allows for truly hidden posts that only you and the people you notify know about. This way your regular readers aren't asking you why they can't access certain posts and nobody knows that you're posting items in secret.

Also as of this release the old GitHub project repository is officially deprecated. It will be coming down soon, so direct any support requests to [the contact page on this site](http://top-frog.com/contact/). Thanks!

You can [download the new version here](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/post-password-plugin/).

Enjoy!
