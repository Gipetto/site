There's plenty more folks out there that can be more poignant and eloquent towards eulogizing Steve Jobs so I'm going to leave that with them.

Without an Apple computer company backed by Steve there's a good chance that I wouldn't be doing what I'm doing, where I'm doing it, and would have missed out on some very influential relationships in my life. So I'll keep this short.

Thank you, Steve.
