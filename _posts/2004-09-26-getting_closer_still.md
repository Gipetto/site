I'm moving ever so slowly on this site – I just haven't had the time that I'd like to to work on it.

But I have got some done, like the admin section. I can now add stories via a form instead of having to drop into phpMyAdmin each time. Next I'll have to make a way to edit stories that way too – shouldn't be too hard now that the new story form is there. I should only have to change a mySQL query and make a list of stories to chose from to edit. 

I did get some work at the dog park today.<!--more--> Okay, it's not a dog park, but we're kind of making it that. But anyway, talked more with a gal that needed someone to slap a friend of hers into shape with her email. I probably should have told her &#8220;I don't do windows&trade;&#8221; but I guess work is work and being the first time she asks me for help I couldn't really turn her down. Could be a stepping stone to more work as she seems to have a lot of contacts.

But that again takes away from personal time. I quit doing freelance work and put Top Frog on hold so that I could have more time with the Wife and Dogs and to work on the new house.

Well, I guess we'll just have to see where it leads.
