The [PuppyCam](/puppycam) is back for a while, if not a bit worse for wear. The camera is having some exposure problems that I can't quite get fixed because the driver isn't letting me properly change settings and the auto settings wants to overexpose the scene.

While its not the best scenario right now it does use existing equipment and gets the page functional again.

I may have a plan to replace it though.



#### To buy or not to buy

I've been wanting a network addressable camera for quite some time. That would really give me freedom to put the camera just about anywhere since it doesn't require the camera to be nearby like this Logitech QuickCam does.

I'm just debating wether I want to spend money on that because the el-cheapo ones start around $80 and I can't just buy the cheapest one. That wouldn't be right.

#### Possible interim improvement

I had an idea this morning that I'm gonna have to play with. Our little Nikon Coolpix 4300 is sitting mostly unused and I'm gonna have to see if Evocam can use that. If it can the autofocus and better exposure capability will be a huge improvement over the QuickCam. I'll have to play with it a bit tonight and see.

There may also be a way to script Image Capture but I may loose motion sensing and have to go down to a constant time delay. But I'd prefer not to do that since that could quickly fill the hard drive if I don't keep an eye on it.

Until then, enjoy the return of Puppycam. It is active from 8am â€“ 5pm, though I may change that to be 7:30 depending upon what time Andy likes to leave for work in the morning. I leave at ~6:40 and I'm not sure what time she gets out of the house.
