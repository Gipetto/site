The wife noticed a flash in a trash can in our alley and asked if it was mineâ€¦ I said no and asked her to bring it to me. Someone had thrown away a poor ol' Vivitar 283 Flash.

After a little cleanup he still has some paint on him, but not on the bulb, and he works fine. Maybe a bit slow on the recharge, but otherwise he's in fine operating condition.

I've got the wife trained very wellâ€¦ spotting photography equipment on the fly like that. ðŸ˜‰
