Well the Coding Monkeys have done it again with their latest release of [SubEthaEdit](http://www.codingmonkeys.de/subethaedit/index.html).

At the risk of sounding like a paid advertiser – I'm really excited about the block edit feature. It allows you to select a block of code and apply the same changes to each line by typing directly – no futzing with a dialog box. In all fairness I saw this first in a program called TextMate, but TextMate was odd in its setup and not very friendly to use.

If you do any kind of coding (all 3 of you that actually see this page) check it out. It encompasses many different coding languages and has command line integration. 

Very handy stuff.

Though I still think it should have a file browser or project window/sidebar – it is still the most comfortable coding application I've used. I find myself in Zend Studio a lot because it has a file browser and project manager, but I'd love to ditch it completely for SubEthaEdit.

Think they'll listen? I can only hope.
