I'm down and feeling lazy. I'm having a hard time applying myself and concentrating on projects. I'm looking for easy ways out.

It could be that I've not been able to really finish a project at work that I've needed to do for some time. It's all been rush stuff that other people decide are more important. I need a kick in the ass.

<!--more-->

I've got great stuff to do, using RSS feeds as a way for resellers to show the most up to date info on products, a blog so our c-level folks can talk to resellers, redesigned product pages that make our information much easier to browse, a redesign of the crappy Support Wizard system (yes, that's the real name – stay away from it if you've been looking into it), a redesign of our eStore from the standard templates, etc… 

I need a way to shake the funk – I'm a bit down on work because I don't feel like I can get things done. Its not that I dread going to work, there's really only one thing wrong with work and it is Bill Gate's fault. 

I just can't seem to find a groove that gets me working full steam and being able to concentrate on the job.

I guess it could be described as a case of the blahs. I don't want to do personal projects either because I don't have that momentum of getting things done (as is obvious by the current state of the PuppyCam). I'm relatively organized, I know what's going on, what needs to get done, and to a certain degree what is down the pipe. So its not that I'm disorganized, I just feel, well, a bit discombobulated (if that makes any lick of sense what so ever).

I'm in a funk! Help me!
