Its that time of the year again. Time for the annual [Crowd Favorite](https://crowdfavorite.com) trip to the ballpark. Tonight it was the Brewers that were in town to hand the Rockies a last minute loss. Boo! Oh well. I got free beer, pizza and hotdogs. As far as I'm concerned the game was great! ðŸ˜‰

Also managed to pull off a decent panorama. I should have gone around to the right some more, but overall I think it's OK.
