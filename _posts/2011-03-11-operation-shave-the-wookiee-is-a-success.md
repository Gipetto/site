Now that's a far cry from [where I was](/2011/03/05/operation-shave-the-wookiee-is-under-way/). No more fuzzball. No more fro. Sorry I couldn't do more to cover up the blemishes. I'm tired and my allergies are driving my eyes nuts.

All in all it was a good night. Combining web donations with direct foundation donations I totalled $1000 raised via this little stunt. That wasn't even close to being at the top of the collections list this year. Some folks managed to collect more than $10,000â€¦ amazing and fantastic.



The actual shave process was quite entertaining as well. The two gals at the end of the shaving line were both eager to get to shave my head and the announcers had some fun with it as well. I actually enjoyed getting a little attention.

And last, but not least, for everyone's enjoyment: (sadly this has been lost to the black hole of Dropbox).

Enjoy, and thanks to everyone who contributed!
