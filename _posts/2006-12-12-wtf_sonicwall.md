My SonicWALL TZ 150 has a firewall filter rule limit of 20. Yep, I have a $360 router that can only make 20 firewall rules. I'm about ready to set this thing on fire and try to get my WatchGuard unit back because even though it had slower wireless it at least didn't have limits on something as basic as firewall rules. That's cheap.

For what its worth: the WatchGuard had a better interface, a more versatile VPN (didn't require a special client for OS X connectivity), and the wireless was more powerful as well.

So, there's my gripe. It was short, so take it or leave it.
