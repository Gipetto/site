I can't say where I originally heard this, but it is frequently in the back of my mind and came to the front tonight while on a walk with the dogs.

We have a lot of bats around here and Andy and I used to go out to the part just to watch them. We haven't done that in a while but tonight got buzzed by a bat while walking the dogs.

We'll have to spend more time in park at night. Bats are fun to watch.
