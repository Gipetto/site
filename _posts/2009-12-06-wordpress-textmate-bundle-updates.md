There's been a few updates to the [WordPress TextMate Bundle](http://top-frog.com/projects/wordpress-textmate-bundle/) recently.

  1. **Function Definitions:**Use the keyboard shortcut Command-Shift-H while the cursor is within or highlighting a WordPress function to bring up a tooltip that contains the current function's usage and path to the file that defines the function.
  2. **Goto Function:** Included is functionality for defining the location of your local install of WordPress. This is defined in the plugins preferences (Command-Option-,). When this is defined the keyboard command Shift-Command-Option-H while the cursor is within or highlighting a WordPress function name will open the WordPress core file that contains the function definition for the current function.
  3. **ReadMe.txt File Validation:** Plugin README.txt files can now be validated from within TextMate. Simply select &#8220;Validate Plugin ReadMe&#8221; from the Bundle's menu to send the current document to the online validator. Make updates to the ReadMe content and submit the changes directly within the popup window.
  4. **Widget Template update:** Replaced the WordPress 2.7+ Widget Object template with one from [Mark Jaquith](http://markjaquith.wordpress.com/2009/08/31/textmate-wordpress-widget-snippet/). </ol> 
    Hopefully these are useful additions. I know I use them, in fact, its why I added them. 
    
  Enjoy!
