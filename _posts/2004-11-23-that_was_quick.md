Swapping out a water heater is pretty darn easy for someone who knows what they're doing.

After only 3 hours of work we now have a new 50 gallon water heater that is double the efficiency of the old unit. It really wasn't that hard to top the efficiency – the old one was 20 years old!

What was scary was all the brown sludge we drained out into the street. To think that we drank that water – we should have replaced that thing sooner but its just one of those things you don't think about until it breaks.

Another scary thought was the buildup on the inside of the input and output valves – I'm guessing our water pipes look the same way since they are all older than that water heater. We're probably losing a ton of water pressure there.

So now that we've opened up that can of worms, we're probably gonna want to replace most of the piping in this place before we redo the basement. Then we can have Scott do it and spread the work around to our friends. We can get the plumbing and electrical done by guys we know and who have done good work for us in the past. And since we know them personally there's a good chance we'll get the best of their attention. Not that I distrust journeymen – it is just so hard to trust anybody these days the comfort level of having a competent friend like that is nice.

So, now to start planning the basement and get started on the yard. We're still debating aspects of the yard but we should be able to get it started soon. That'll be nice and should reduce the amount of crap the boys track into the house. In fact I have muddy footprints on my jeans right now…
