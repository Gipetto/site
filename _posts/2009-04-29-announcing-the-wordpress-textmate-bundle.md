As the name implies this is a [TextMate](http://macromates.com) bundle to assist with [WordPress](http://wordpress.org) development. Where I work we're on WordPress almost every day doing this or that and it gets pretty tedious to not only remember the schizophrenia that is PHP syntax, but the schizophrenia that is my own code as well as the schizophrenia that is the WordPress code base (don't take that the wrong way, pretty much every code base out there is a little bit schizo). 

To that end I got together with my co-worker [Gordon](http://gordonbrander) and started hacking together this bundle. Gordon's a detailed oriented guy, and I like to pretend to be, so together we were able to sufficiently over-analyze the situation and put together what we feel is a heck of a good resource for developing under WordPress with TextMate ([someone I know](http://gregorygrubbs.com/) has already taken part of it and converted it to emacs! Heathen ðŸ˜‰ ).

So if you're a TextMate user you should check out the [WordPress TextMate Bundle](/projects/wordpress-textmate-bundle/ "WordPress TextMate Development Bundle") and let us know what you think! This is the first official release announcement and it is bound to have a bug or two, so if you find anything be sure to let us know at the GitHub project page.
