%} This is a photo taken at Dillon Resevoir just outside of Dillon, CO.

I actually took this photo when out trying to catch a meteor shower but messed up my dates and went out a day early. I caught no meteors on film that nightâ€¦

Andy spent the evening in the car hiding from bears.

I believe that this was a 30 minute exposure. It was taken with a Canon EOS 10s with a Sigma 24mm f2.8 lens.
