<img class="alignright" src="/assets/monty.jpg" alt="Monty Python and the Holy Grail Movie Poster" />My, oh, my, how I had forgotten how good that movie really is. And when you see it with 8,500 other eager fans you can count on having a good time. The venue was Red Rocks Amphitheater, the movie, of course, was _Monty Python and the Holy Grail_ (aka: Monti Python ik den Holie Grailen). Granted, a few of the subtleties of shadow detail are lost when viewing outdoors but when you get the sound of clacking coconuts from all around you all is forgiven… what a wonderful way to see this movie.



#### She's got huge… tracts of land!

The show started just after dusk, and after a live concert by a local brass band who did a whole Monty Python themed night, complete with a sing-a-long to Sir Robin's tales and the Camelot skit. The amount of people not reading the words during the singing was disturbing – they really should have been reading along with the movie screen…

#### Look at the bones!

I was a little worried at first that I had blown the night since I waited so long to get tickets. Fortunately there were plenty of tickets on sale up to the start of the show (which eventually sold out) and we were able to join Angie and Charlie who had been there since 5:30! They saved some great seats for us, but wow, 5:30. The show started around 8:30 and we didn't actually get home until 11:45. Thanks again to Angie and Charlie.

#### You mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries!

Ah, so many quotable lines, I could keep going. All I can really say now is that if you have an outdoor movie program in your area, go, just once, especially if they're playing a classic such as this. I don't think I would have come out for _Terms of Endearment_ but probably would have shown up for _Attack of the Killer Tomatoes_ or _The Rocky Horror Picture Show_ just because the audiences that would attend shows like that are worthwhile company.

#### Get on with it!

Despite how much fun we had at the movie I think the funniest thing all night was while we were waiting to leave. We didn't want to fight traffic so we just hung out in the back of the truck waiting for the cars to filter out. We had a front row spot to watch the dance so we just relaxed in the bed of the truck while someone else nearby blared Iron Maiden's Number of the Beast. But by far the height of the night's entertainment was a carload of teenagers making barnyard noises while waiting to be signaled out of the parking lot. They were thoroughly entertaining.

#### What, behind the rabbit?

Yes, I really am raving about a screening of Monty Python at an outdoor concert venue. Fantastic! Two enthusiastic thumbs up.
