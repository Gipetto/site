Its kind of becoming a personal tradition to take a cappy iPhone panorama before the game whenever we get tickets to an Avalanche game. So, that said:

Hopefully last night was a good sign of the season to come. A young and energetic team with a goalie that can stand his own. I don't expect much from them this season, but if they play like they did last night then they're gonna be fun to watch wether they win or lose.

Oh, and [see ya 'round, Joe!](https://www.nhl.com/news/avs-retire-sweater-of-longtime-captain-joe-sakic/c-500689) Thanks for the memories.
