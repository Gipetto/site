I got one of my presents early since we had to go pick it out. A [Tippmann A-5](http://www.tippmann.com/product_guide/markerDetails.aspx?categoryid=1) with 20oz. tank and goggles. FUN!

There are some minor mods that I'd like to do to it that include a shorter barrel (either 5" or 8") and modifying the air tank attachment so that it points forward and not backward. The whole idea would be to make the gun compact and easy to dart around with.

I'm pretty excited about this. 

My monkey treats me so good.
