Somebody with too much time on their hands (really, I'm not jealous) has developed a plugin for Mozilla Firefox called [Fangs](http://www.standards-schmandards.com/index.php?2004/11/22/8-fangs-release-05).

It is a screen reader emulator for FireFox. It seems that there is currently a bug in OS X in which the window cannot be closed but it is a great tool for checking accessibility.

Can't wait for this to get out of beta.
