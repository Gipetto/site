I bit the bullet and entered this manually into iCal. I don't really know if anyone here is an Avs fan but here it is. It has dates, times, locations and TV channel.

It was made on Tiger but should be backwards compatible. Windows users can import the file into Outlook, Palm users can import the file after changing the file extension to .vcs
