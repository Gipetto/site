We woke up this morning to find that the little sticky trap that we'd bought worked and caught our mouse.

The unfortunate part, and I knew it was coming, was that he was still alive. Plastered to the glue, breathing heavy, trying to get loose. Basically he was scared out of his mind.

The next decision was what to do with him.

One suggestion was to let him freeze to death. It is all of 18 degrees outside right now, so he'd be sure to die within an hour or so.

Another option was to kill him. This is the more humane thing to do and was actually easier to deal with.

Despite the way I carry myself and how my personality is – I'm a softie when it comes to animals. I just can't bear to do them harm. But in this case it was the best thing to do. The little guy wouldn't go in the no-kill trap so we had to glue him down.

I took him outside in a plastic bag – which was probably even more frightening for the little feller – put him under a box I could get my foot into and squished him. I made sure he was good and flat 'cause I didn't want him to suffer much more than he already had.

It sucks. Him being in the house didn't bother me, really, it was what he could be carrying and the fact that he was all over the kitchen counters that made the decision a no brainer.

I didn't like doing it, but it had to be done.

Who would think that something so small could effect me so much. Its just a mouse, but I killed it. You'd think I was 12 years old by the way I'm reacting to this.

He was just so cute…
