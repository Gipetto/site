A huge thorn in my side is the appropriate use of Reply-All vs. Reply when replying to an email. I don't have a problem hitting reply all when I notice that the message was directed to more people than just me, I typically don't notice that it was sent to more than just me, so I'll just hit reply without thinking of it.

The solution? Take the idiot out of the equation and remove the Reply button so that there's only a Reply All button. I can't believe that it took me this long to think of this solution.

I'm sure my opinion will change the first time I reply with "he's an idiot" with that person on the threadâ€¦
