Since I kinda don't have time to drop a whole new site into place, and since this **is** my testing server, technically, I'm going to be phasing in this new look over a few days.

Well, hopefully over a few days. The reality is I probably won't have the transition completely done for a while. But my goal is a few days.

So, lemme know what you think so far. I'd love to hear it.
