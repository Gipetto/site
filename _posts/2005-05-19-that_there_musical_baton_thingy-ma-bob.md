Well, surprisingly enough I got passed the [musical baton](http://milkcarton.protonage.net/?p=66) that's been making its way around [teh intarweb](http://www.google.com/search?rls=en&q=musical+baton). It started out that Joey was passing it to me as a stolen item but then this [John Oxton](http://joshuaink.com/) character went and made it official ;p. I have to admit that there was a sense of fun associated with being a rebel, but I guess I'll have to put down the hair grease and put the leather jacket away. I'm keeping the '55 chevy though.



So, without any further bad humor, here it goes:

#### Total volume of music

43.88GB, 11238 songs, 31 days. Most are encoded at 128k AAC. All this resides on a file server and I keep about 13GB on my 20GB iPod.

#### Last CD that I bought

The last CD that I bought was [Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge](http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=14748657) (iTMS link) by My Chemical Romance from the iTunes Music Store.

#### Song playing right now

Paranoia! Cha-Cha-Cha by [_The Soviettes_](http://www.thesoviettes.net/).

#### Five songs I listen to a lot, or that mean a lot to me

  1. Posession by _Sarah McLachlan_ 
  2. Yellow Ledbetter by _Pearl Jam_ 
  3. Cecilia by _Simon & Garfunkel_ 
  4. I'm a Fake by _The Used_ 
  5. Bright Eyes by _Bonnie Tyler_ (yes, you read that right)

#### Five people to whom I'm passing the baton

  1. [Andy Parker](http://puddlemonkey.com) 
  2. [John Pennypacker](http://blog.pennypacker.net) 
  3. [Joel Schou](http://www.joelschou.com) 
  4. [Scott Hill](http://www.smhill.net) 
  5. [Harold Land](http://www.halbie.com)

* EDIT

#### Looking back

As I track back the lineage of this particular baton I find it fun to go through and see what other people's musical tastes are. I'm also finding a few bands to go back and get a better listen to as I start to Google some of these new bands that have been listed. I hope everybody that I've passed it to participates as though it means nothing at the very least it is interesting to be able to track the lineage of a &#8216;virtual chain letter' (as John P. labeled it).
