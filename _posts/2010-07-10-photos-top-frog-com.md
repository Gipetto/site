I've been putting off doing something like this for a while now, but I finally broke down and signed up for a [Zenfolio](http://www.zenfolio.com/) account so I can try and sell some of my photography. I figure its gotta be worth something to someone, right? 

So, ~~[photos.top-frog.com](http://photos.top-frog.com)~~ is the site and possibly, at this time, one of the worst implementations of Zenfolio theming in recent history.

Its mostly event photos now, spurred by trying to quickly put together a venue for sharing and selling photos of my Dad's racing clubs. The events currently on the site now are:

  * [Porsche Club Rocky Mountain, June 19, 2010](http://photos.top-frog.com/p61606756)
  * [Denver Chalk Art Festival, June 6, 2010](http://photos.top-frog.com/p781256650)
  * [4th Annual Denver Zombie Crawl, October 24, 2009](http://photos.top-frog.com/p1030084802)
  * [Porsche Club Rocky Mountain, September 19, 2009](http://photos.top-frog.com/p806328788)
  * [Rocky Mountain Vintage Racing, May 17, 2009](http://photos.top-frog.com/p20033038)

So, as time goes on I'll be putting more stuff up. Pretty much pruning just the good stuff from [my flickr account](http://flickr.com/photos/tehgipster) and seeing if it flies. I've got a year to figure out how to pimp it and make it work before having to renew the account. Hopefully now the addiction can feed me a bit now instead of the other way aroundâ€¦ ðŸ˜‰
