We're all excited to see that [TextMate 2 Alpha has been released](http://blog.macromates.com/2011/textmate-2-0-alpha/). It was a long wait but by the looks of the Alpha it appears that the wait wasn't wasted. There's plenty to be happy about with the Alpha.

I've been doing some cursory testing with the WordPress Bundle and so far it appears that only a few minor modifications might be needed to be compatible. 

Better yet, though I haven't fully tested this yet, the changes should be backwards compatible with TextMate 1.5. For the time being it doesn't appear as thought I'll have to create a branch just for TextMate 2.

So, keeping in mind that TM2 is Alpha, I'm pleased with how things are panning out. I'm eager to get in to the guts the new bundles and figure out what more I can do to make the WordPress bundle even better (suggestions are welcome!).

Congratulations to Mr. Odgaard on his release. I hope he's able to ignore the petty jerks who keep harassing him and finish up what already looks to be a kick-ass upgrade.
