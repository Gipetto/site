As if it wasn't a given, most of my hits come from Mac users. I hear a lot of rumblings around that points to Safari not being the browser of choice among many Mac users due to this bug or that bug but it still dominates my browser list.

IE comes in at 3rd in the list, surprisingly. I can't think off the top of my head who those windows users might be…

In any event, for those who care (and to bore those of you who don't) here is the browser matchup for the Gippy Pages:



  1. Safari (42.8%) 
  2. Firefox (31.8%) 
  3. MSIE (11.5%) 
  4. Unknown (5.1%) 
  5. NetNewsWire (4.1%) 
  6. Mozilla (2%) 
  7. Camino (1.2%) 
  8. Opera (.4%) 
  9. Netscape (.2%) 
 10. Konquerer (.2%) 
 11. Others (.1%) 

Now, the presence of NetNewsWire in the list makes me wonder if Safari is on top due to common usage or because people use it's built in RSS reader to preview and then view full articles which would garner more hits attributed to the browser. Unfortunately AWStats doesn't distinguish between versions of OSX so I can't count who is on what… I'll have to look into a hack for that.

Either way – good on Safari – it is my browser of choice despite its bugs, though I should spend more time in [Shiira](http://hmdt-web.net/shiira/index-e.html).

The really scary thing is to check the web stats and see that I still get hits from IE 4, Netscape 4, Web TV Browser, and Firebird (precursor to Firefox).
