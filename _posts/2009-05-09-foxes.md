Every year its not a matter of if we'll get foxes in the neighborhood or not, its a matter of where they'll be. This year we got a family of 2 adults and 4 young-uns just down the street from us.

I've seen one or two on occasion as the weather gets warmer, but recently they've been out as a family, rummaging through the grass and bushes in search of something to eat, or just to take some time and play.

They're cute. Damn cute. So damn cute I want my next pet to be a fox! ðŸ˜‰ This little guy on the left took a particular interest in me for a while but eventually just stopped paying attention to me and just ate some grass so I could get some fun shots of him with just a 50mm lens (~80mm on my 20D). He still manage to get [a pose](http://www.flickr.com/photos/tehgipster/3514792789/in/set-72157617815630609/) or [two](http://www.flickr.com/photos/tehgipster/3515601634/in/set-72157617815630609/) in, just for good measure.

One of the adults was trying to get behind me for a while but eventually gave up. The entire group knew I was there the whole time but eventually just accepted that I was going to be around just went about their business. I got to witness a few mice becoming breakfast and a lot of play between the siblings. It was a very entertaining morning.

Most shots were with my Tokina 80-200 f/2.8 which, unfortunately, didn't produce the sharpest shots 'cause I was shooting at ISO 800 at f/2.8 most of the time. This unfortunately disqualified most of the long distance shots as too fuzzy to show off. Anyone pixel peeping the large versions will notice that most of 'em are just a little bit soft. 

There's more to see at [The Flickr photoset page](http://www.flickr.com/photos/tehgipster/sets/72157617815630609/). Enjoy!
