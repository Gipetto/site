Am I the only one who couldn't care less?

Probably not, but still, I sometimes feel like I am. 

I wrote and rewrote this post many times because each time I started to ramble and my disdain for the church comes out each time.



I have a hard time coming to terms with the place of religion in a modern society and I really should write out my feelings on the matter because sometimes all I feel inside is disdain for the church and all that it has done (and not done) throughout history.

I have a lot of similar feelings about politics (and politicians) and can see many parallels between politics and religion, and not just the influences they have on each other.

I wonder if it would be productive to follow up and write out and organize my thoughts on religion & politics, wether I would have anything different or even coherent to say on the matter. Wether what I have to say is more based on feeling than fact or based more on how religious and political leaders treat those who they are sworn to serve. They are supposed to serve us, right? Right?
