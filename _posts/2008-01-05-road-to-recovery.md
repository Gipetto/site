%} Maybe its a bit cliche, but its fun imagery. We wanted recovery to be right around the corner, or just over that hill. Once a good stock image of a roadway was found I constructed the road sign in PhotoShop to make the scene. Pretty straight forward but a fun use of smart objects and vector drawing tools.
