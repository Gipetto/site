I don't normally comment on something that should be posted to the links section but this seemed worth writing about.

[Pookmail](http://www.pookmail.com/) is service that offers temporary email addresses. Any emails sent to that temporary address will be forwarded to an address that you specify when signing up. The address expires 24-hours after creation.

This is such a wonderful concept. How many times have you signed up for something that you have to supply an email address for but don't need it permanently? Spur of the moment site registrations? Or that one time registration to get the free e-book? Now you can sign up for things and not get onto spamming lists. Simply sign up with a pookmail address and don't worry about it.

I never would have thought about providing this service but at the same time I wonder why it didn't pop up earlier.
