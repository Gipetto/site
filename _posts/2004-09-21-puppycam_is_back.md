The [PuppyCam](/puppycam) is back up. Fortunately, there was no damage to the camera so it is functioning perfectly.

They've been given the run of the house while we're away. They let themselves out the doggy door so we can trust them not to poop in the house. At least, we hope we can…

The cam will shut off at 5:00 MST, about when we get home from work, so, sorry, no watching us… just the pups.



**EDIT: seems that keeping it up and running may be a more interesting feat than I thought. I have to find a way to get the webserver closer to the camera so I don't lock down another computer to running the puppycam.
