<span class="thumb_box"><a href="http://www.fuzzycoconut.com/xhtmlr"><img src="https://top-frog.com/images/works/xhtmlr_thumb.png" alt="XHTMLr (beta) HTML Syntax Search" /></a></span>The name plays off the older Web 2.0 trends of funky names being copied from Flickr and constant beta status of a lot of emerging projects. The [XHTMLr](http://www.fuzzycoconut.com/xhtmlr) is the beginnings of an online companion to the [Fuzzy Coconut XHTML Reference Widget](http://www.fuzzycoconut.com/widget/). Designed to be clean and straight forward it still needs a database expansion to have more detailed sample information since we have much more room to work than we did in the widget.
