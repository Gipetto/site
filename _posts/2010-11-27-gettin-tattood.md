The wife got some new ink by Willie Stewart at [Ananda Tattoo](http://anandatattoo.com/) (the website is seriously lacking, but his work is fantastic) and I got some time be a dork with the camera. The place was a bit dark so I had to augment with some flash. I put a Vivitar 285HV set at 1/16 power on my Gorillapod with a light sensitive trigger and pointed it towards the wall to bounce (you can see the 285 in the photo above in the middle square window to the right of the door). I then put my old Canon 430 EZ on the 7D, pointed him at the ceiling, and pulled him back to 1/32 power. With the small space this gave me some very nice, even illumination with all the bouncing that was going on and was able to shoot comfortably at 1/100 sec at f/4. All the good shots ended up being with the 60mm Macro, though I did shoot with the 10-22mm a bit.
