Got a bit more done, though less than I should have.

URLs in entries are now translated into links, I'm showing comments, the titles page is nicely formatted now.

Next implementations are gonna be: adding comments, a page where I can add stories instead of doing it via phpMyAdmin (I wanted a working system before i did that, then I wasn't changing the page every time I changed or tweaked the system, and trying out a &#91;more&#93; tag to cut off long posts on the front page.

If that &#91;more&#93; tag works, then you shouldn't see anything below this paragraph.



This is more text… It should only show up on the Archives pages
