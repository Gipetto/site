<img class="alignright" src="/assets/articles/sp-shawn.png" alt="Me, as a South Park character." />Saw this first over at ~~[Mr. Scott's site](http://smhill.net/article/129)~~, so I can't say I'm the first. But I thought it was hilarious to do. Notice I'm not wearing any pants â€“ the possibilities for accurate self representation are definitely there.

Check it out over at ~~Planearium~~ (page no longer exists). Make one, post it here using the image tags. It's what all the cool kids are doing, really, I'm a cool kid.

Thanks for the link Scott.
