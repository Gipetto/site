<img class="alignright" src="https://top-frog.com/images/articles/sp-shawn.png" alt="Me, as a South Park character." />Saw this first over at ~~[Mr. Scott's site](http://smhill.net/article/129)~~, so I can't say I'm the first. But I thought it was hilarious to do. Notice I'm not wearing any pants â€“ the possibilities for accurate self representation are definitely there.

Check it out over at ~~[Planearium](http://www.planearium2.de/flash/sp-studio-e.html)~~. Make one, post it here using the image tags. It's what all the cool kids are doing, really, I'm a cool kid.

You can also check out a thread in progress [over at the clubhouse](http://clubhouse54.com/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?p=134661).

Thanks for the link Scott.
