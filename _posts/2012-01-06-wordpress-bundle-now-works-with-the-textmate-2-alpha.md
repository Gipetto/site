It was easier than I thought it would be. It boiled down to some environment variables changing a little bit. No biggie.

So, there it is. TextMate 2 Alpha support. If you notice anything weird please open a [Support Ticket on GitHub](https://github.com/Gipetto/wordpress.tmbundle/issues). Please include the full text of the error that you receive as that'll most likely be what I need to fix the problem.

WordPress 3.3 support is hot on its heels. Really!
