Seems that there is an easy way of clearing floats, one that seems to be surprising to so many people that it is hard to beleive it is that easy.

[SitePoint.com](http://www.sitepoint.com/blog-post-view?id=238086) has the writeup about how adding **overflow: auto;** can cure all that ails ya with clearing floated objects.

They provide an [example of the theory in action](http://www.sitepoint.com/examples/clearing_floats/example2.php) and it sems to work very well.

Who knew, it is easyâ€¦
