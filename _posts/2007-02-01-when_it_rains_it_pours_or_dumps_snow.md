I haven't felt like I've really had a handle on anything at work or at home for quite a while. I feel like I'm just trying to make it from day to day without losing my head. Literally, I sometimes feel like I've lost it.

Not that its a bad thing. I'm really busy at work, work is interesting, there's plenty to do at home (not that I'm doing any of it) and I'm getting some good freelance work.

For some reason, though, I just can't get to a point where I feel like I'm caught up or at least at a place where I can think and do interesting stuff. Playing catch-up all the time is hard on the brain. 

Yeah, I know: woe is meâ€¦ I'll get caught up one of these days. And maybe I'll have something interesting to write about too! I'm resisting writing about all the snow, but that gets harder with every storm.
