A bloody dog fight…

You won't be thanking me for this pic.

More details soon.

**Update:** So, 9 stitches and 1 sedation later bear is home and sleeping it off. He not only had the tear in his ear but had a puncture wound in his face.

Hopefully he learned something from this as it was a fight he started…
