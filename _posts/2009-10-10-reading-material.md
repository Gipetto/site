I'm finally admitting that I'm not gonna grow up and getting back to reading comic books. I had always known about Usagi Yojimbo by just seeing at comic shops but never picked it up to give it an honest look. It wasn't until I saw an exhibit of [Stan Sakai's work on Usagi Yojimbo](http://www.flickr.com/photos/tehgipster/3584440878/in/set-72157619227022757/ "Usagi Yojimbo exhibit at the San Francisco Cartoon Art Museum") in San Francisco that I really got interested.

So, its snowing outside, I have nothing much planned for the weekend other than walking the dogs, cleaning the kitchen (it needs a good scrubbing) and maybe checking out the art museum to see what's new, so I should be able to get some quality time in with my new friends.
