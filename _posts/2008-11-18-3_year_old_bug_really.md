<valleygirl>Seriously?</valleygirl>

I was being diligent, not upgrading Apache through MacPorts 'cause I didn't want to deal with the [3 year old bug that causes and Apache upgrade to overwrite your vhosts file](https://trac.macports.org/ticket/8605), but MacPorts decided that since I was upgrading PHP that Apache should be upgraded as well.

So it blew away my vhosts file.

Bastards.

Oh, and, [Time Machine](http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/timemachine.html) to the rescue!
