Just a few off the cuff shots. I tossed the 100-400 and the 1.4 extender on and THEN had to add my circular polarizer to get a decent exposure of 1/5000 @ f/11. And this was while I was also setting up a new grill.

If anyone at Char Broil Grills is reading: Were you stoned when you designed the T-22D?

Anyway. By the time the eclipse was in full swing most of the neighborhood was in the street hanging out, talking about it, and looking at my live view shots to see how it was progressing.

I know I took a chance using live view to shoot. But I made sure to work quickly. I was shooting handheld (why not at those speeds) so the sensor wasn't being constantly blasted. That and it only made sense to take a few new pics every 5 minutes or so. Better a fried 7D than fried eyeballs.

I started off shooting in the back yard but was eventually obscured by houses uphill from us. Luckily I have trustworthy neighbors that I could trust to watch cars for me as I shot from the middle of the street ðŸ˜‰ Though in retrospect I wish I had thought [to look down](https://twitter.com/#!/selviano/status/204385356433465344)
