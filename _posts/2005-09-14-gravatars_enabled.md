I wasn't sure if I really wanted to join a trendy web thingy. I was kind of enjoying being basic and clean.

But I got sucked in. [Gravatars](http://www.gravatar.com) have been added.

So, clean up those gravatars, boys and girls, and be sure that they're transparent because your grav just might end up on a shaded background. That means you're gonna look funny with that non-transparent gravatarâ€¦ \*cough\*Joey\*cough\*Tom\*cough\*

And, for those that don't have a gravatar, we've got a nice generic frog to keep your spot warm. Go ahead, sign up now, you know you want to.
