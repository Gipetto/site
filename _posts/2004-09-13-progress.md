Well, things are chugging along, I've added categories and overall cleaned things up. 

I made a booboo though, I mismade the setup for the sidebar and main block, so I can't do a footer like I'd want to. Either that or I'm stupid and can't figure it out.

Either way, it has to be fixed. Going back and having to redo things sucks, so it may be screwed up for a while so I can get other things implemented.

On a positive note, I did implement an [FIR technique](http://www.mikeindustries.com/blog/archive/2004/08/sifr) on this site – it was pretty easy too. Someone else did all the work, I'm just using his technique. It's a bit weird in that if someone does not have Flash installed they get some rather large headlines, but I can live with that for now.

Oh, and this site still looks like ass in WinIE.
