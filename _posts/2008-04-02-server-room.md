<img class="frame" src="/assets/articles/server_room.jpg" alt="A digital composite made of Janitorial Equipment crowded in a server room.">

We needed a shot of a server room crowded with janitorial equipment. Something that no IT Manager would ever let happen, not even if the equipment were dry and empty and if everybody &#8220;promised to be careful&#8221;. Just not gonna happen. So I got permission to shoot our server room and then reconstructed the angle in another part of the building to get the equipment at as close an angle as possible. Next I composited them together, added some suds and a puddle and opened up the right side to fit the banner design I wanted to do.

This photo shoot didn't just yield this composition. I also came out with a fantastic shot of the Server Room at work â€“ a typical &#8220;Hero&#8221; angle. Because of the tricky lighting and that I only had 2 functional flashes with me this ended up being a composite of multiple shots.
