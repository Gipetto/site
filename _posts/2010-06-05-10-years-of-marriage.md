<blockquote cite="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0073312/">
  <p>
    To love is to suffer. To avoid suffering, one must not love; but then one suffers from not loving. Therefore, to love is to suffer, not to love is to suffer, to suffer is to suffer. To be happy is to love; to be happy then is to suffer, but suffering makes one unhappy; therefore to be unhappy one must love or love to suffer or suffer from too much happiness. I hope you're getting this down.

16 Years ago we met at the University of Northern Colorado and there's been no looking back. We've grown together for so long I can barely remember who we are when we met. But I guess that doesn't matter because I like who we've become and look forward to how we'll change over the next 10 years. 

Love you, wife.
