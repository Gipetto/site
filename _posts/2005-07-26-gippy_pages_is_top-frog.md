Well, I finally got around to it. Using the advice of [Tom and xSmurf](/2005/07/09/darn_that_dyndns) I've finally gotten this site a domain. I had www.top-frog.com just pulling duty as a place to stuff, well, stuff. Now it is the new home of the [Gippy Pages]().

So, if you've actually bookmarked this monstrosity, please update your bookmark to the new address.

Just for the record, too, [Andy's site has moved to www.puddlemonkey.com](http://www.puddlemonkey.com). I bought that url for her a while ago but it was suffering the same fate with no DNS to point a domain name with.

Thank you [ZoneEdit](http://www.zoneedit.com)! And thank you [Tom](http://www.milkbasilica.com) and xSmurf.
