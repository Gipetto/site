These conversation snippets are from conversations with my Nephew. I really wish I could remember more of them as they're always thoroughly entertaining.

**Adult:** You'd better stop fussing in the chair or you'll fall out and break. Then what would we do with you?  
**Nephew:** You have to throw me out with the trash?

**Adult:** So, girls have cooties, huh?  
**Nephew:** Yeah.  
**Adult:** Your mom's a girl, ya know.  
**Nephew:** No she's not.  
**Adult:** Yes, she is. So's your Guma (grandma).  
**Nephew:** uh-uh!  
**Adult:** Yep, your mom is a girl.  
**Nephew:** No she's not, she's my mom!

**Adult:** What's your name?  
**Nephew:** Joshua Thomas  
**Adult:** Why is that your name?  
**Nephew:** Because that's my name!
