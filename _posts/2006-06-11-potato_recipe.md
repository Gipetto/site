This recipe can be considered heart attack on a plate. Its simplicity defies its taste and deadliness. This one is a calorie demon!

But its good.



#### Kitty's Potatoes

_6-8 Large potatoes  
2 Cans cream of chicken soup  
1/2 Pint sour cream  
1/2 Cup butter  
1 1/2 Cups grated mozzarella cheese  
1/2 Cup grated parmesan cheese  
1/2 Cup minced onions_

Boil potatoes until a fork enters the potato easily. The potatoes want to be firm, not soft.

Combine all the ingredients, minus the potatoes, in a large bowl.

When potatoes are done, cut into slices. Lay down mixture and potatoes in layers in a 9" x 13" pan.

Cook for 40 minutes at 350 degrees. Let sit for 10 minutes before eating.

Refrigerate leftovers â€“ this reheats very well.

Enjoy.
