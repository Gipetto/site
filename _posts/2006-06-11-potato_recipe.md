#### Kitty's Potatoes
{: itemprop="name"}

- {: itemprop="recipeIngredient"} 6-8 Large potatoes  
- {: itemprop="recipeIngredient"} 2 Cans cream of chicken soup  
- {: itemprop="recipeIngredient"} 1/2 Pint sour cream  
- {: itemprop="recipeIngredient"} 1/2 Cup butter  
- {: itemprop="recipeIngredient"} 1 1/2 Cups grated mozzarella cheese  
- {: itemprop="recipeIngredient"} 1/2 Cup grated parmesan cheese  
- {: itemprop="recipeIngredient"} 1/2 Cup minced onions

{: itemprop="recipeInstructions"}

When potatoes are done, cut into slices. Lay down mixture and potatoes in layers in a 9" x 13" pan.
