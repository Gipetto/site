Did you see it this morning? I wasn't here. No, not physically – the domain was gone. My registrar failed to tell me that they changed their payment system and now required more information to bill credit cards than before.

My domains for `top-frog.com` and `puddlemonkey.com` expired because the registrar failed to inform me that to continue the auto renew schedule that I needed to now provide the security code from the back of my credit card. On top of that it had to have been a recent change because I had two domains, `topfroggraphics.com` and `fuzzycoconut.com` auto-renew back in August of last year.

That said – if you own domains checking in on them from time to time might not be a bad idea just to make sure everything is still OK.

Fortunately for me I was re-registered and running again before 10am.
