Read an interesting article today on [css signatures](http://www.rdrop.com/~half/Creations/Writings/TechNotes/css.tip.2.html). And is has a great idea in it.

The concept of a css signature is to label your body with an identifier that is unique to your site, like:

``` html
<body id="top-frog-com">
```

This way someone can use a custom stlye sheet to change something they don't like about your site. Granted, few of us would really like for someone to strip a bunch of formatting from out sites because we have a vision on how we'd like to present our data – but how many times have you run accross a site that had one, or maybe two things that bugged you but otherwise you like the site, or for some reason or another you need to change the size of just one type of text on a certain site, or maybe someone writes great articles but their background image makes it unreadable.



That can all change if css signatures get the following that they should have. With that simple id in your body tag someone could create a user style sheet and very easily change something they don't like and keep them on your site.

I know there are a few sites I'd like to easily do this to – maybe to change link text, kill a strike through on a visited link. Nothing major. I think it would be a nice convenience to add to any site. Granted, there will be the people who feel the need to change things just because they can, but for the most part I think it would give users a great foothold to making your (and my) site more pleasing to them.

This could also make a neat screenshot thread – pimp my site where we encourage people to make custom style sheets for out sites just for shits and giggles. I think that would actually be kind of fun – like css zen garden for dorks.
