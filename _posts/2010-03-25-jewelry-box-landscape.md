A high key look at a jewelry box that belonged my grandmother.

The only adjustments made were to sharpness, contrast and a slight straighten and crop. Other than that its pretty much straight out of the camera. There's one little hair that I'd like to take out but I'm still learning the ropes on the Lightroom 3 beta that I haven't figured out how to do that yet (or if I even can, the cloning tools seem a little strict compared to Aperture).
