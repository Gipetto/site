#### Oldie but Goodie

<span class="thumb_box"><a class="thickbox" href="/stuff/map?KeepThis=true&TB_iframe=true&height=300&width=300"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/top-frog.local/wp/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/image_map_thumb.png?resize=95%2C79" alt="Image Map Thumbnail Image" title="Image Map Thumbnail Image" width="95" height="79" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-425" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></span>Why should the image map be ignored? Its understood by every major browser around and is perfectly suited to do what some people insist on doing in flash. [This sample](/stuff/map) shows a simple North American map divided up into regions and the rollovers controlled by some very simple JavaScript code. JavaScript was lifted from some Macromedia code I found, nothing special, and could be rewritten using newer JS and CSS and take significantly less lines.
