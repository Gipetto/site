I started running today. I'm following the Couch to 5K program via an app on my iPhone.

I came to a stark realization recently that my weight was getting out of control. I'm fortunate enough that I carry weight well, but that's also been a reason why I've been able to let it go for so long. At 6&#8242; 1&#8243; the true nature of being 245 lbs. is starting to show. Both in how I look, how I feel and how I now have to wonder if I'll meet pre-set conditions on activities. My father got a free session at an indoor skydiving joint here in town and he doesn't want to do it. He gave it to me and I'm pretty stoked about it since it looks like a lot of fun. But I noticed that they have a 250 lb. weight limit. Depending on the scale, I may not qualify right nowâ€¦ that was quite the shock.

So, off I go. I've got a little bit of a head start since I bike to work as my primary means of transportation. Not to mention the 5 lb. computer, the 2 lb. camera and ~ 5 lb. of lenses that I schlep with me. So with all that on a 15 minute ride in to work I've been able to at least stave off lost cause status.

I'm hoping to be able to do the [Denver Gorilla Run](http://www.denvergorillarun.com/) in late October. It'll be tight but I'm hoping that I can accelerate the C25K schedule a little bit to make it. Maybe I can talk a few folks in to doing it with me. (To be honest I'm really just in it for the Gorilla Suit ðŸ˜‰ )

I think I'll make it. I have good inspiration. The wife started running earlier this year and she's already run two 5Ks and continues to run at least 3 times a week. I'm super proud of her and just seeing the changes in her body and how she feels is good enough motivation for me to start as well. I've definitely got some catching up to do.

So now that I have an exercise plan in place I need to look at my diet. That's gonna be the hard part for me. I love my food. And your food. And his food. well, you get the ideaâ€¦
