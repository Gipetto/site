I was going over my time spent dealing with the chemo and was able to figure out some interesting numbers. Okay, maybe interesting to just me, but here goes:

  * **117 days** from beginning chemo 'till returning to work.
  * **20 days** of chemo treatments.
  * **3 days** spent overnight in the hospital.
  * **2 visits** to the hospital ER.
  * More than **100 hours** spent in the oncology ward.
  * More than **70 liters** of fluid pumped in to my body.
  * More than **50 pokes** with a needle.
  * More than **15 vomit sessions**.
  * More than **12 days** spent sleeping all day.
  * More than **8 doses** of morphine.
  * Up to **5 days** between significant meals.
  * Up to **5 days** between poops. But also…
  * … **2 episodes** of shitting my pants.

The most important number of all, though, is the **2808 hours** of unconditional love from the wife.
