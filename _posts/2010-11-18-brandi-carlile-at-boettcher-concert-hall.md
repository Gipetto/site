I finally got to shoot the 7D at a concert at only ISO 3200! And was able to shoot at f/4 for a little depth of field. How sweet it is ðŸ˜‰

To say that Brandi Carlile came to the Boettcher Concert Hall on November 13, 2010 would be an understatement. She and her band made the place their own with a performance that varied from the subtle to the rockin'.
