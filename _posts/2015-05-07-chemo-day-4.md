That's me putting on a brave face for the camera. Again, Chris' credit card pays off in spades.

I got a different nurse today. He was good. It looks like this hospital is staffed pretty well.

I slept through most of the treatment. We came home and I slept some more. The nausea is pretty well under control, but still overwhelming at times. I still haven't pooped. I'm full of Ex-Lax and Milk of Magnesia so we'll see what the morning brings.

I got a nice FaceTime interlude from my co-workers as they drink off the stress of the run-up to next week's conference. That was nice. Awkward, but nice.
