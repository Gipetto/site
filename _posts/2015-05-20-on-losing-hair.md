I started to lose hair this week. Its coming out in clumps. Not everywhere, mostly my face and my ass. I finally trimmed back the goatee because it was getting a bit gross losing long hairs all over the place. That and my skin hurts a bit (I don't know if that's normal or not).

I didn't think that it would effect me that much when it started happening, but something is going on between my ears, I just can't pinpoint what I'm feeling. Maybe the last, unavoidable, step of reality on the situation is here. One more thing out of my control that I just have to deal with.
