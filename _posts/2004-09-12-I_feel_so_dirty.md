I have a Windows&trade; machine on my desk. An **old** HP Omnibook.

It's staring at me as it does a virus scan. I'm sure it is plotting my death as I write this. I only want it for testing purposes and to have a wireless machine to sit on the deck with. And it was free, so what could I do? Throw away a perfectly usable machine?

Now, I know what some of you are thinking. Why didn't you put Linux on it? Well, I did, but I couldn't get wireless to work on it, so I guess I'm just not geek enough to be able to do that. Though I would prefer to be looking at a gnome desktop than Winders. And I know where to get some a Unix toolkit, so I think I'll be ok.

If I disappear though, it was probably that machine that killed meâ€¦
