I headed out to the [Colorado Sport International Airshow](http://www.cosportaviation.org/) today and had a pretty good time until my foot started bothering me. I think these shoes are toast 'cause I don't have foot problems. I left early, before the 2nd air demonstration with the jets. Boo. Its probably for the best. The light wasn't favorable (everything in the air was pretty much backlit) and I wasn't shooting well anyway.

**Update:** A few more from yesterday:
