I got to head out and shoot a Porsche Club track day at High Plains Raceway a couple of weeks ago. I've finally got enough of the images up to call 'em a set. But the one I like the best includes MY car ðŸ˜‰

If you're interested in seeing a lot of Porsches on the track then check out the [full set on Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/tehgipster/sets/72157622419764446/) (which, hopefully, will be completed some day now â€“ uploading has been going slow).
