<img class="alignright" src="/assets/articles/wp-logo-cropped.png?resize=166%2C124" alt="" title="wp-logo-cropped" />I can actually say that I'm timely on this one! The [WordPress TextMate Bundle](/projects/wordpress-textmate-bundle) and the [WordPress Clippings for BBEdit](/projects/wordpress-clippings-for-bbedit/)have been updated for [WordPress 2.9 &#8220;Carmen&#8221;](http://codex.wordpress.org/Version_2.9). 

There wasn't a lot that changed as far as the bundle is concerned, most of it being about a shift in line numbers of where the functions are located in the core so that the Jump to Function action works properly. There's also a built in About page now that provides documentation on the plugin as well as credits to the folks who have helped out. 

The versions of the Bundle and Clippings that are compatible with WordPress 2.8 have been tagged at GitHub, so they're still available through a direct download or git checkout.

On a side note, a less used (and maybe less practical resource), my [WordPress Hooks Tag Cloud](/htc) has been updated for the new 2.9 version (and, 2.8â€¦ whoopsie!). If you're looking to see where a certain [action or filter](http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API) is used you can find that out there.
