[<img class="th" src="https://top-frog.com/images/articles/abandoned-car-thumb" alt="image" />](https://top-frog.com/images/articles/abandoned-car.jpg){:.thickbox.frame}To continue my photography posts I'm posting an image I took while at school at the University of Northern Colorado. I can't remember what year it was taken – I didn't document that for any of my college photography.

Photo was taken with an old Canon FT QL that my father gave me, probably with a 50mm lens, and for sure was on Fujichrome Velvia. I wish I still had that old camera…
