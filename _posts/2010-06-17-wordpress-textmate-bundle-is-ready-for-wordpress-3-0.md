[<img src="https://i0.wp.com/s.wordpress.org/about/images/logo-blue/blue-m.png" alt="" title="wp-logo-cropped" class="alignright size-full" data-recalc-dims="1" />](http://wordpress.org)Today marks the release of WordPress 3.0 and with this release the [WordPress TextMate Bundle](http://top-frog.com/projects/wordpress-textmate-bundle/) is ready for it. 

The bundle had been updated to support the new features in WordPress 3.0 including, but not limited to: custom post types, featured images, and WordPress MU integration. The menu has been rearranged a little bit and a slew of new commands and snippets have been added. Hopefully, :knock-on-wood:, no bugs have crept in.

So, go and get [WordPress 3.0](http://wordpress.org/download/) and update your [WordPress TextMate Bundle](http://top-frog.com/projects/wordpress-textmate-bundle/)!
