Look, ma, we're famous! Ok, not really.

Thanks to the guys (and gals?) over at Bare Bones my [WordPress Clippings for BBEdit](/projects/wordpress-clippings-for-bbedit/) are now listed on the [Official BBEdit Clippings Library page](http://www.barebones.com/support/bbedit/clippings_library.html).

Now I'll have to see if I can talk them in to some kind of developer discount as I haven't had a chance to test newer versions of the Clippings since my trial ran out.
