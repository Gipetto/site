Found a nice little bug in the stable version of MySQL5 in the [MacPorts](http://macports.org) repository yesterday.

Version is 5.051a and when using `GROUP BY` it ignored `ORDER BY DESC` and returned results in ascending order.

Its been a known bug since MARCH.

The MySQL5-devel port is working fine in the mean time, but holy shit. I have to wonder a few things.

1. how did it take me this long to find the bug (to my credit, I have no idea when macports pushed 5.0.51x).
2. why in the world hasn't it been fixed or patched yet?

**Edit:**

Now that I think a bit harder on the issue I might have noticed it earlier and chalked it up to being a n00b when I wrote other queries. When I upgraded this site I had to rewrite some queries that had mulitple joins and group by statementsâ€¦ I wonder if that was the same bug?
