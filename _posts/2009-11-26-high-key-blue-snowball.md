I've been having fun just playing around with a single flash. This one is on the right track, but I blacked out the front a bit too much. I think with a little more fill up front this idea could be a winner.

This is a Blue Snowball microphone, in case you're interested. The wife has been taking voice acting lessons and this is how she's doing her homework. We don't have a really good area to do it yet, so we're getting a bit of echo from the hardwood floors and walls and ceiling and bookcases and, well, you get the idea ðŸ˜‰
