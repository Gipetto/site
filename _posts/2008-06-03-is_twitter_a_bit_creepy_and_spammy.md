I was a bit late to the [Twitter](http://twitter.com) party (I'm [WookeeBoy](http://twitter.com/wookieeboy), if you're interested). I see the value, and the fun, but am finding that part of it makes me feel a bit awkward. 

I've got followers. Not many. Some are friends. Others are, well, I don't know. Its kind of weird. Some Tweet a lot, others not so much. Some can spell. One in particular can't spell for shit. I'm sure they came across me in one fashion or another but what made them want to follow me really makes me wonder: who are you and what are you doing here?

One, in the last 5 minutes even, was SPAM! SPAM SPAM SPAM on Twitter! Sheesh.

Another one has no posts, but is following 36,851 people. I don't get it.
