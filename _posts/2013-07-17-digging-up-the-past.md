In a good way.

I've been wanting a slide duplicator for some time now. I've got a lot of slides from college as well as a lot of family slides that I want to digitize. I picked up a Pentax Bellows M with Slide Duplicator off of eBay for a damn good price.

Below is a quick test with minor adjustments. I attached an old Pentax K mount Sigma 70-200 on there and adjusted it in to place. And voila. Mom, Dad, my Sister & Iggy the dog. The date says December 1973 but I think that's probably the processing date and that the photo is from earlier in the year.

The original wasn't the sharpest photo in the world, but looking at how sharp the dust specks are I think this setup will do just fine ðŸ˜‰

I would have much preferred to use one of my 50mm Pentax lenses but I needed to pull back to get the right magnification adjustment for the APC sensor in the camera. Maybe now I need to find myself a nice 85mm lens to use here? Just don't tell the wife I said that ðŸ˜‰

I've never been able to justify a dedicated slide scanner. But for $80 shipped I couldn't pass this up. So now I need to dig up a bunch of slides and get my parents to mail me what they have all boxed up and get to work.

Its a lot to do but I'm quite looking forward to itâ€¦
