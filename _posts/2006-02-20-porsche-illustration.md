<a class="thickbox frame" title="Porsche Illustration." href="https://top-frog.com/images/works/Porsche-with-Paths.jpg"><img src="https://top-frog.com/images/works/porsche-thumb.png" alt="Porsche Illustration." /></a>This started out as a personal project to learn the advanced features of Adobe Illustrator and turned into a 20+ layer monster.
