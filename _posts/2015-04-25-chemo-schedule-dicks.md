I have a chemo schedule now. Starting May 4 and ending with my last infusion on July 10. I'm going with &#8220;EP&#8221; chemo which means that I'll get both etoposide and cisplatin for 5 days in a row. Each cycle is 3 weeks with 1 week of infusions and then 2 weeks off. This will happen 4 times.

The doctor recommended getting a port so that getting hookup up and under way is easy each time. I didn't care either way so I went with his suggestion. I'm not great with needles so if it means that there's less hunting for good veins as time goes on then I'm pretty sure that's a good thing ðŸ˜‰ There's a minor risk of getting extra surgery to have it put in and taken out, but I can deal with it.

Lastlyâ€¦ this showed up on my doorstep:
