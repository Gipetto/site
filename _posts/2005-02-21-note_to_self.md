I haven't read this yet, but am leaving it as a reminder for me to read it as I need to bone up on my JS.

[Unobtrusive JavaScript](http://www.onlinetools.org/articles/unobtrusivejavascript/).

Now I really need to get my links box working so I don't have to put this into an articleâ€¦

Also leaving a note to read [A Tribute to CSS Selectors](http://www.stuffandnonsense.co.uk/archives/css_a_tribute_to_selectors.html). More stuff I need to bone up on.
