    <p>From time to time something tickles my fancy enough to make it a personal project. When they turn out well
        enough I like to try and give a little back. Feel free to use anything you find here, just let me know if
        you end up using something as I like to know if what I’m doing is being found as useful or not.</p>
    <p>Thanks!</p>

                autocomplete values so that not only does it reduce the need to look up function calls, but their
                parameters and arguments as well.</p>

            </h4>
            <p>The jQuery Togglr Plugin is designed to eliminate some of the redundant code that we end up using a lot
                at work. A lot of admin areas in WordPress benefit from the ability to show and hide content. With the
                Togglr Plugin this can be achieved quickly and consistently and it degrades nicely if some other plugin
                kills your javascript.</p>

            </h4>
            <p>The SP Source Code Highlighter plugin for WordPress is a free plugin that taps the power of the Pear
                Text_Highlighter class to provide attractive and layout flexible code blocks for your blog. It requires
                the ability to install Pear packages on the server, so the plugin is not for everyone.</p>
