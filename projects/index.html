    <p>From time to time something tickles my fancy enough to make it a personal project. When they turn out well
        enough I like to try and give a little back. Feel free to use anything you find here, just let me know if
        you end up using something as I like to know if what I’m doing is being found as useful or not.</p>
    <p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>A daily trivia game that is the brain child of my brother-in-law.</p>
            <p>Built using Sveltekit and Supabase using only the bare minimum of NPM libraries and with artisinally 
                crafted CSS. It is fun to work on and the subject matter is interesting as well.</p>

            </h4>
            <p>I’ve always been drawn to the resume as an exercise in design and presentation. This is a 
                (typically) up-to-date resume built on whatever shiny framework is en-vogue at the time 
                that I decide to try something new.</p>

            </h4>
            <p>A bolt on forum slogan system built on PHP & SQLite. A good excuse to play with modern 
                PHP. It started as something to build from scratch, to see how much could be done as 
                simply as possible, but quickly ballooned once we started caring about quality and 
                stability. Functional and performant, but still needs work.</p>

                password by creating secret token urls for the post.</p>

    <h3>Obsolete, but not forgotten</h3>

    <p>These projects are all archived, obsoleted by time, or by the tooling no longer being relevant.</p>

                <a href="/projects/wordpress-textmate-bundle">WordPress TextMate Bundle</a>
            </h4>
            <p>WordPress is a large codebase. You need help getting around.</p>
            <p>This is a TextMate bundle with a lot of common actions built in with convenient
                autocomplete values so that not only does it reduce the need to look up function calls, but their
                parameters and arguments as well.</p>

            </h4>
            <p>The jQuery Togglr Plugin is designed to eliminate some of the redundant code that we end up using a lot
                at work. A lot of admin areas in WordPress benefit from the ability to show and hide content. With the
                Togglr Plugin this can be achieved quickly and consistently and it degrades nicely if some other plugin
                kills your javascript.</p>

    <h3>The Trash Pile</h3>

    <p>These preojects are abandoned, and I should probably delete them to protect my reputation, but I'm leaving them here for posterity.</p>
    <p>Browse, but don't use these for anything but an example of what not to do in a modern world.</p>

            <p>WP Interactive allows admin users to run PHP code directly via the WordPress Admin to assist with
                development of plugins and themes.</p>

            </h4>
            <p>This is a Clipping bundle for BBEdit 9+ to help make working with WordPress (hopefully) a lot easier. It
                includes function completion for WordPress functions, actions and filters as well as Carrington Theme
                Framework functions.</p>

            </h4>
            <p>The SP Source Code Highlighter plugin for WordPress is a free plugin that taps the power of the Pear
                Text_Highlighter class to provide attractive and layout flexible code blocks for your blog. It requires
                the ability to install Pear packages on the server, so the plugin is not for everyone.</p>
