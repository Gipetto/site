This post is well overdue. Mama has been with us since August 2020.

After losing Stella to cancer in May, we decided soon after that we wanted another dog. So we looked around a bit and landed on this 8 year old velvet hippo named Mama. Mama spent most of her life on a farm. Her former owners tell us that she showed up on the farm one day with puppies in tow. She was probably a year old at the time. They eventually found homes for her puppies but decided to keep her.
