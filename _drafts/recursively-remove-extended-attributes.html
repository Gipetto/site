<p>Every once in a while I run in to a problem with downloaded files having extended attributes of <code>com.apple.quarantine</code> that prohibit the files from being opened.  <code>com.apple.quarantine</code> is a flag that OS X uses to label applications that have been downloaded from the internet so that it can throw a dialog asking you to confirm opening the application, but this also has the side effect of disallowing the file from being accessed by a web browser or included in to a PHP application. </p>
<p>For 1 or 2 files the files can be opened to trigger the dialog, but for larger libraries this becomes really troublesome.</p>
<p>This is a bash snipped that will recursively remove all extended attributes from a directory. Add it to your <code>.profile</code> or .bashrc and run it from the directory where you're having issues.</p>
<p><code class="sh">rmextattr() {<br />
	find . | while read filename<br />
	do<br />
	     while read attr<br />
	     do<br />
	           echo "removing ${attr} from ${filename}"<br />
	           xattr -d "${attr}" "${filename}"<br />
	     done < <(xattr "${filename}")<br />
	done<br />
}</code></p>
