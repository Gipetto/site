<p>Just a short while ago I got a call from a recruiter about wanting to talk to me about a job. Normally I would have just ignored it but this one came about a job in San Francisco. I like San Francisco. So does the wife. So to see what it was all about I took 'em up on an initial screening to see what the company was about and to see if I was interested. </p>
<p>I think you've probably guessed by now I was interested.</p>
<p>The next 6 weeks turned in to the longest interview process that I have ever been through. The longest interview sessions, and most code samples, the most "homework assignments" and the most individual interviews that I have ever been exposed to.</p>
<p>Doing this made me realize that while I'm comfortable with the amount of knowledge that I have and with the concepts that I can present and use, it turns out that I can't articulate my knowledge for shit.</p>
