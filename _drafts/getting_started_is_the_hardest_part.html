<p>I'm turning this site into "The Gippy Pages."</p>
<p>I need an outlet for my brain and figure this is the best way to do it. The navigation will be in shambles for a while, but bear with me, all 3 of you that will see this, and this should work out fine.</p>
<p>The goal is to have an attractive place to spill my brain and not push a lot of bandwidth. Its not going too bad so far - I've even managed to keep it all validating as xhtml 1.0!</p>
<p>Next steps: add comments and try to implement a bb style code system.</p>
