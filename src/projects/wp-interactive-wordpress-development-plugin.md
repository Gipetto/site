## WP Interactive Plugin

<img src="/assets/projects/wp-interactive-screenshot.png" alt="" role="presentation">

WP Interactive allows admin users to run PHP code directly via the WordPress Admin to assist with development of plugins and themes.

~~More documentation coming soon, but the plugin is stable and very useful.~~

You can download it at <a href="https://github.com/Gipetto/wp-interactive">WP Interactive’s Github page</a>. There are currently no plans to submit this to the WordPress plugin repository. I think it might be a little too dangerous to offer up for n00bs to download. No offense, n00bs, but this plugin can do some serious damage to your install if you’re not careful.
