<h2>Projects</h2>

<section class="active-projects">
  <p>From time to time something tickles my fancy enough to make it a personal project. When they turn out well enough I like to try and give a little back. Feel free to use anything you find here, just let me know if you end up using something as I like to know if what Iâ€™m doing is being found as useful or not.</p>
  
  <p>Thanks!</p>

        <p>A daily trivia game that is the brain child of my brother-in-law.</p>
        <p>Built using Sveltekit and Supabase using only the bare minimum of NPM libraries and with artisinally
          crafted CSS. It is fun to work on and the subject matter is interesting as well.</p>

        <p>Cowsay. For PHP.</p>
        <p>Yup. I blame this existence of this on my chemo treatments having fried my brain.</p>
        <p>This composer library allows you to bring the quirkiness of Cowsay to your PHP applications.</p>
        <p>The cows are fully configurable and thereâ€™s an easy to follow pattern for adding your own variations.</p>

You want your dragon to breathe fire? <a href="https://github.com/Gipetto/CowSay/blob/master/docs/CustomTraits.md">You can do that too with custom traits</a>.</p>

        <p>Iâ€™ve always been drawn to the resume as an exercise in design and presentation. This is a
          (typically) up-to-date resume built on whatever shiny framework is en-vogue at the time
          that I decide to try something new.</p>

        <p>A site for my mother's business, Patches Etc., a chenille patch and embroidery business that focuses on the High
          School sports market. But she can make patches for anything you need. And she'll sew those patches on to your letter
          jacket in a way that will last for longer than your high-school sports career.</p>
        <p>Built on Eleventy js, with a sprinkling of Sass for styling, and just a little bit of Javascript.</p>

      <p>A bolt on forum slogan system built on PHP & SQLite. A good excuse to play with modern
        PHP. It started as something to build from scratch, to see how much could be done as
        simply as possible, but quickly ballooned once we started caring about quality and
        stability. Functional and performant, but still needs work.</p>

        </h3>
        <p>WordPress is a large codebase. You need help getting around.</p>
        <p>This is a TextMate bundle with a lot of common actions built in with convenient
          autocomplete values so that not only does it reduce the need to look up function calls, but their
          parameters and arguments as well.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>The jQuery Togglr Plugin is designed to eliminate some of the redundant code that we end up using a lot
        at work. A lot of admin areas in WordPress benefit from the ability to show and hide content. With the
        Togglr Plugin this can be achieved quickly and consistently and it degrades nicely if some other plugin
        kills your javascript.</p>

  <h2>The Trash Pile</h2>

  <p>These preojects are abandoned, and I should probably delete them to protect my reputation, but Iâ€™m leaving them
    here for posterity.</p>
  
  <p>Browse, but donâ€™t use these for anything but an example of what not to do in a modern world.</p>

      <p>The SP Source Code Highlighter plugin for WordPress is a free plugin that taps the power of the Pear
        Text_Highlighter class to provide attractive and layout flexible code blocks for your blog. It requires
        the ability to install Pear packages on the server, so the plugin is not for everyone.</p>
