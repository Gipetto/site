~~Puddlemonkey.com~~ has received its long overdue redesign. The update also puts the site on WordPress.

The site is about the writing so the design is meant to be playful and stylish, yet still leave the content as the main focus.

There's still plenty of work to be done but this gets it off the ground and should alleviate the "I'll write when it looks better" argument that I've been hearing for a long time now (pretty much since the last version of the blog was abandoned). 

So, here's to PuddleMonkey – head on over and check out ~~Puddlemonkey.com's new digs~~. Be sure to mouse over that header a bit… I still just marvel at its sheer useless eye candy.
