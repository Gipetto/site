The [Post Password Token Plugin for WordPress](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/post-password-plugin/) has been updated to version 1.0.2. This includes a minor bug fix for a permissions error when using the link from the plugins page to access the plugin options. 

If you're not experiencing issues there's no immediate need to update. Accessing the plugin from the link in the WordPress Admin Sidebar works as expected. This in no way effects the functionality of the plugin.

This release also moves the plugin completely away from GitHub to reduce redundancy in hosting/versions.
