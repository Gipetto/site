This recipe can be considered heart attack on a plate. Its simplicity defies its taste and deadliness. This one is a calorie demon!

But it is good.

### Kitty's Potatoes

- 6-8 Large potatoes  
- 2 Cans cream of chicken soup  
- ½ Pint sour cream  
- ½ Cup butter  
- 1 ½ Cups grated mozzarella cheese  
- ½ Cup grated parmesan cheese  
- ½ Cup minced onions

1. Boil potatoes until a fork enters the potato easily. The potatoes want to be firm, not soft.
1. Combine all the ingredients, minus the potatoes, in a large bowl.
1. When potatoes are done, cut into slices. Lay down mixture and potatoes in layers in a 9" x 13" pan.
1. Cook for 40 minutes at 350 degrees. Let sit for 10 minutes before eating.
1. Refrigerate leftovers – this reheats very well.

Enjoy.
