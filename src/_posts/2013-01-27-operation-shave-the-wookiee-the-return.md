Here we go again.

[St. Baldricks](http://www.stbaldricks.org/why-we-exist) is 2 months away and I'm in once more. Its been 2 years since I last pitched in and I've got 12&#8243; of hair waiting to be shaved. 

On my head, you pervert.

[Last time was a success.](http://top-frog.com/2011/03/11/operation-shave-the-wookiee-is-a-success/) After all was said and done and last minute donations tallied I managed to raise a little over $1200. Thanks to everyone who donated. It was much more than I was expecting.

And here I am. Ready to go again. On March 30, 2013, at the Children's Hospital & Research Center in Oakland, California, I'll once again sacrifice a full head of hair in the interest of raising some dough for a good cause.

[Give me, er, the kids, money!](http://www.stbaldricks.org/participants/mypage/588242/2013) 

Or join [Team Wookiee](http://www.stbaldricks.org/teams/mypage/82145/2013). I'd be thrilled to have teammates. I'll need someone to celebrate with since my wife has already made it clear that I'll be sleeping in the other room until at least some hair grows back. However, I've just been informed that if I raise at least $2,000 that she'll actually sleep with me while the hair grows back.
