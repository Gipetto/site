Today marked day 2 of the Denver Chalk Art Festival in downtown Denver. It may have been a bit TOO nice of a day today as all I can remember is that it was HOT. Damn hot. Any time I went down for a lower angle I was reminded of the heat from the street. I wouldn't have survived out there for 2 days 'cause I'm not that diligent about drinking water when my brain is occupied with something. 

The heat aside it was a wonderful display of art and a fun way to spend the day. If you missed it this year then put it on your calendar for next year. And get there early, the crowds like to show up later in the day.

A few more from today:
