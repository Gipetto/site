Yep.

Work has been time consuming. I've been reading more (currently reading up "[World War Z](http://www.randomhouse.com/crown/worldwarz/)"). I've been focusing more on photography and boning up on my lighting skills. Been programming plenty, just all at work.

Life is good, but this poor, poor, excuse for a blog is dying a horrible death. He didn't totally like the server upgrade, I think it was the change in MySQL, and I still haven't fixed all of it. This code base is so old I could probably ditch it and rebuild with the framework that I've since built and save a ton of time.

htDig didn't like the move either. And apparently I've left Magic Quotes on in PHP. And the RSS feed is borked. Hm.

I just browsed the code baseâ€¦ how amateur! How far I've come. Wow.

Maybe I will switch the framework and keep writingâ€¦ I do enjoy dumping garbage on the internet once in a while ðŸ˜‰
