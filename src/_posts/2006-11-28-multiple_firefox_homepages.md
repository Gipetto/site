I'm probably the last one to notice this, but I thought it was pretty neat.

Place a bar character, `|`, inbetween entries in the Home Page entry box in the Preferences pane and Firefox will start up and open each entry in a new tab.

You can get this same thing by opening up pages in tabs how you'd like them to open, go into the preferences, and then click on the "Use Current Pages" button in the Main preferences.

A nice touch to an already fantastic browser.
