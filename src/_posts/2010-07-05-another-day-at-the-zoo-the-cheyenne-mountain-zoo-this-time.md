Spent a nice day with the folks down at the Cheyenne Mountain Zoo in Colorado Springs. The zoo is great. Damn nice for podunk little city like that ðŸ˜‰ The giraffe exhibit is certainly something to go for. They don't like being touched but its damn cool to get that close to them.

I'm a little weirded out by the results of the day. The camera interpreted the light very strangely and everything seems a bit warm. I hope to have properly accounted for it in the processing. View the [full set of images on Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/tehgipster/sets/72157624424365694/).
