The [Clubhouse 54 Traveling Postie](http://www.clubhouse54.com/) made it my way a while back and I finally got around to taking a pic or two… this is the best one.

It was shot with our little ol' Nikon Coolpix 4300 and didn't turn out too bad. I manipulated the flash with a piece of paper and heavily edited the lighting in Photoshop. It actually came out decent…
