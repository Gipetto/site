Found this lil' guy making his way across the sidewalk this morning while walking the dogs. So, naturally, I interrupted his walk to talk a few picsâ€¦ he was rather confused about suddenly being in the air and moving around. Didn't make him any less active, though. Lil' bugger was hard to shoot 'cause he wouldn't sit still.
