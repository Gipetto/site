I got the chance to step back in to the role of Concert Photographer on Friday night and I'm pretty excited about it. The Denver Post's [Reverb Music Blog]() gave me a shot (and one more coming up soon) to see how I'd do. I think I did pretty well considering the place was a cave and I had to break out the flash to keep 1/125 of a second at f/2.8. The old 20D gave me all she had and actually came through pretty well despite her shortcomings. It can't write fast enough for quick shooting and the autofocus just plain gets confused sometimes. I spent half the show in Manual Focus.

So here's hoping that the Editor liked my stuff as much as I enjoyed shooting. [Read the full review of the show and see the entire gallery here](http://www.heyreverb.com/2010/10/30/live-review-seasons-after-rhythms-sports-bar-grill/).
