Ever. Sheerly out of principle.

<img class="oversize" src="/assets/articles/no-hdcp-for-gippy.png" alt="iTunes says: This movie cannot play because iTunes is requiring HDCP copy protection and making my not-so-old TV useless for iTunes video watching" title="no-hdcp-for-gippy" />

This is from a Macbook Pro "Late 2008" connected to a Samsung HDTV over VGA because all of my HDMI ports on the TV are taken.
