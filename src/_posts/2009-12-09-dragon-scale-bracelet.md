Read on to see the setup for this shot.

I'm doing some photography for [Siouxsiequeues](https://siouxsiequeues.com), a friend who makes hand made chain mail jewelry. Its turning out to be a fun exercise. I don't have a heck of a lot of room to work and don't have some of the proper tools for doing studio work, but we make due with what we have, eh? So, consider the attached photo above and then check out the setup shot below. I used:

  * 3 muslin shims cut out from a cheap-o &#8220;studio box&#8221; aparatus
  * 2 monkey wrenches
  * 3 pieces of cardboard
  * 1 medium box
  * 1 roll of packing tape
  * 3 pieces of duct tape
  * 2 pieces of cardboard
  * 1 black sheet
  * 1 black ceramic cylinder (purchased for $1.99 at Goodwill)

  alt: "A photo of the setup used to create the dragon scales photo. It is a table top setup with a lightweight shim set up as a tent between the subject and the lights. Two wrenches hold the shims in place. Cardboard is used to prevent light spill on the background to maintain a deep black behind the subject."
