The WordPress TextMate bundle has been updated for WordPress 2.8. New items include:

  * quick access to esc_ functions. Mark Jaquith [great writeup of the new escaping functions as well as the reasoning behind them](http://markjaquith.wordpress.com/2009/06/12/escaping-api-updates-for-wordpress-2-8/)
  * new WordPress 2.8 widget templates. Head over to WP Engineer for a [tutorial on the new widgets](http://wpengineer.com/wordpress-built-a-widget/). The new OO structure is a welcome change. Very, very welcome.

Get more information on [the WordPress TextMate Bundle project page](/projects/wordpress-textmate-bundle/), download it from the [Github project page](http://github.com/Gipetto/wordpress.tmbundle/tree/master), or, if you installed it via [GetBundles](http://svn.textmate.org/trunk/Review/Bundles/GetBundles.tmbundle/) (which is really the best way to keep up with it) you can simply upgrade it from TextMate. If you don't already use GetBundles, you really should. Use Subversion to install it from that url.
