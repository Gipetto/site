The last two died quicker than the first, they had the benefit of being wacked by some pretty heavy handed traps. But I still feel bad. What an undignified way to go.

Wacked. Then thrown away. 

At least larger animals get eaten when killed. These poor little dudes just got dropped in the trash.

And they're so cute too.
