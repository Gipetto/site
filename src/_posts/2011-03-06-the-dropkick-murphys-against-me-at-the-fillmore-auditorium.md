Getting movement and energy out of every band member on stage is a rarity, but a rarity that is enjoyed when you encounter them. The Dropkick Murphys provided non-stop action on stage which proved not only challenging but fun. Especially with the addition of an 8&#8242; wide box in the middle of the pit that allowed band members to interact very closely with the crowd and which provided on a small channel to shimmy through to get to the other side (as much as I would have liked to have jumped right up and jammed with the band, I didn't).

Getting to photograph these two bands was a treat, indeed. Though I have to admit I was nervous and didn't do as well as I'd have liked. While editing the photos after the show I realized that during the Dropkick Murphys there was a bagpipe player and a hot chick with a violin that I didn't even get shots of. Shame on me! All in all, though, they're decent and I had a good time to boot.

A quick tip to some of you new folks photographing shows: when the security guys tell you that you showed up too late and that the shooting period has ended for that set then you're better off heeding their word. They're not trying to be dicks (they didn't set the 3-song policy, some weird-o somewhere else did), they're just doing their jobs. But when you try to sneak up and take shots after you've been clearly instructed that you shouldn't shoot you endanger access for all of us there. Like it or not we simply don't make the rules. When you push your luck you're pushing it for all of us. Please, show up early and respect not only the rules, but me too.
