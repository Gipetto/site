  alt:"A photograph of an abandoned truck from about the 1940s. What is left of the yellow paint is faded and peeling, and there's no glass in the windows. The yellow color of the grass and car contrast sharply with the deep blue of the sky and the orange rust popping through from underneath the paint."

To continue my photography posts I'm posting an image I took while at school at the University of Northern Colorado. I can't remember what year it was taken – I didn't document that for any of my college photography.

Photo was taken with an old Canon FT QL that my father gave me, probably with a 50mm lens, and for sure was on Fujichrome Velvia. I wish I still had that old camera…
