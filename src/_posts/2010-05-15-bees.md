Encountered a bee hive while out on our walk with the dogs earlier today and decided to go back for a good look with a camera. I'm glad that I did.

Everybody was well behaved. I tried not to move quickly and I'd get landed on once in a while but all in all they didn't seem bothered by me. Which is good 'cause I don't like bee stings.

A couple more from the encounter:
