So, as the Taste of Colorado comes to town I once again get my shot at some free concert photography. This years its Brett Michaels of Poison fame. I admit, I listened to that as a kid. I think their first album came out when I was in middle school. A guy in my class thought by the cover of the album that they were all girls… Though, you can't fault him too much for that one. There was more make-up on the cover of that album than on Dee Schneider.

I fully expected this show to be a train wreck but it was actually quite good. He impressed me by saying &#8220;let's bring the boys home&#8221; during the inevitable dedication of &#8220;Something to Believe In&#8221; to our troops overseas. But, then, he's also wearing a shirt with a picture of himself on it, so there's that to weigh in too 😉
