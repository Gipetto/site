We just got back seeing Serenity and I have to say that it rocks. Hard.

I got a little discouraged before seeing the movie by reading some reviews that harped on it for production value. To those people I say – Hogwash. Just because Lucas didn't speed things up 300 times and sacrifice the blood of 40 children making new technology doesn't mean it isn't good. The technological aspect of the movie was fine. On top of that it was unobtrusive. Unobtrusive is good. The movie was about the story, not how many explosions happened or what overpaid producer / director team decided to rape moviegoers.

I guess I can actually talk about that story for a little bit.



#### Much more than a made for TV movie

I didn't see as many epsidoes of the television series as I would have liked. I saw about 3 or 4 and loved them. I was pretty bummed when the series got pulled because it was a great story with likable characters. Beyond that it was a believable world. The fact that it was in the future was not stressed and not made a central part of the story. The story had much more appeal in its portrayal of a gritty, non-perfect, world. The world was so deep I didn't think it was given enough time on TV to really take hold. 

The movie starts off with some history and nicely brings you up to speed so that you can dive right in and get started. Not having seen too many of the episodes I felt right at home with the story and didn't feel like I was missing out on anything. And on top of that it didn't feel like it was continuing a television show.

If you ever saw the television series and liked it – Go see this. If you're a fan of Sci-fi – Go See this. If you're just lookin' for a good time – leave that number in the bathroom stall and go see this. I'm not going to ramble on about as I don't want to give anything away.

I'll just say: Two very enthusiastic thumbs up.

So enthusiastic that I just added the Firefly DVD set to my Netflix cue so that I can see what I missed.

#### Now I have to rant a little about theater management.

Why are small chidren allowed in theaters? What does a 5 year old care about Serenity? Really. And how is it that a man carrying a plastic grocery bag full of popcorn, that he opened and closed throughout the entire movie, was allowed to bring said bag in? Ok, that's it. Just plain and simple – theater owners don't care about if we have a good time or not just so long as we pay… I think they're suffering from similar delusions as major movie makers who don't think twice about that stupid script that should have been sent to the trash can and not given a 100 million dollar budget.
