Hey, Apple:

I know of all the things that are wrong with the iPhone (what, you mean its not perfect?) is that my icons move with every application update… bah!

Is it a stupid thing to be complaining about? I don't think so. Part of being a designer means having a propensity to be anal-rententive about how things are arranged. In this case my icon arrangement and placement is deliberate and based on categorization and usage. 

Simply put – I placed the icons in that order, and on that page, for a reason. Is it really that hard to remember which icon was where and properly replace it after an update? I'm surprised an interface designer let this one through 'cause it seems like a no-brainer to me that an update should not re-arrange the interface.

Oh, and do something about my battery life. It is atrocious.
