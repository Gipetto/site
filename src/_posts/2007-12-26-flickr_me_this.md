So, I finally broke down and joined [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com). My account is under [tehGipster](http://flickr.com/photos/tehgipster/). 

I tried for a long time to resist and make my own gallery but 1) that never got done, 2) the service is just too damn good, and 3) I finally realized that I just don't want to program that much any more and want to try and focus more on creative work than programming. Now that I have a programmer/DBA at work to help me out that can become a reality.

Not that I don't enjoy a little PHP now and again, but I enjoy my camera and a pencil and paper more. 

So, to celebrate, he's my first real image posting link from here to Flickr. We were snowed in today for Christmas (I can't remember the last time we actually got snow ON christmas) and took the boys out for a walk in the snow. Here's a few images from the outing:
