So, I found a neat little math trick this morning that would build numbers out of ascii characters, so I modded it to respond to user content.

Sound riveting and useless? Ya, well, it is. But it kept me entertained making it.

[The Stupid ASCII Addition Answer Page](/stuff/add.php?a=60&b=9&size=5&char=11&background=8).

#### And then there's the analyticsâ€¦

So, when doing a small project like this that you'd still like to track the analytics on be sure to consider your analytics. Since this stupid page's actions are controlled via query vars I've now got many many variations of the page hit in my analytics. So, consider the ramifications of the stupid little project and filter the vars accordingly.

Gah!
