This site is almost usable. Comments work, and small overall improvements and nicities have been added.

Site still remains xhtml compliant, much to my surprise. I guess I can still learn in my old age.

So I guess this means that I should start to use it for what I originally intended: as a way for me to just get my thoughts out and have a place to babble.

So, that should commence soon, but right now I'm still creating entries in phpMyAdmin â€“ I need to create an entry page so this is easier and automated, and so I can do it from outside the home. I also need to change the URL scheme for the stories â€“ right now they can't accomodate multiple entries on one date, but that is easy to change and I should have that completely in place soon. Maybe even tonight.

Sometime after that I'll see about putting in ~~PuddleMonkey's site~~ so she can use it too. She'll have to edit the look though â€“ I'm not doin' that for her. Well, at least make her beg a little bit ðŸ˜‰

Hm, that last bit makes me want to implement smiliesâ€¦

I should go to bed, I stayed home sick today. I don't feel as bad as I did this morning but I still don't want to go to work tomorrow. But I think that is a normal feeling.

**Update Jan 2019:** For anyone interested, the Wayback machine has a glimpse of what this shanty-town used to look like. Bask in the glory of [The Gippy Pages from 2004!](https://web.archive.org/web/20040923135400/http://gipetto.dyndns.org:80/)
