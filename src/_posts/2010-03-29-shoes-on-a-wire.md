I noticed these some time ago but just haven't gotten around to taking some time to admire them. Today turned out well with a slightly overcast background to give me a nice thick sky and a warm setting sun to light the shoes. Unfortunately, and I say that damn word too much in relation to my photography, I wasn't fully prepared. I should have had a tripod or monopod. These are just slightly soft due to camera shake.

I've always liked the thought of seeing shoes hanging from power lines. Almost like you don't have a real city neighborhood without 'em. We've got shoe cred here ðŸ˜‰

**Update:** A couple more from this afternoon.
