This is mainly to remind myself to give these recipes to a couple of people. That's not to say that you shouldn't try these as they're fantastic recipes. I make no claims to be the creator of these recipes – they were handed to me, source unknown.

### Kansas City Barbecue Sauce 

This Kansas City style Barbecue Sauce recipe is fantastic on ribs and goes strangely well with plain old potato chips.

- ¼ tsp. ground allspice
- ¼ tsp. ground cinnamon  
- ¼ tsp. ground mace  
- ¼ tsp. ground black pepper  
- ½ tsp. curry powder  
- ½ tsp. chili powder  
- ½ tsp. paprika  
- ¼ cup white vinegar  
- ½ tsp. hot sauce (Tabasco)  
- 1 cup ketchup  
- ⅓ cup dark molasses

Sift together all the spices, stir in vinegar, then add hot sauce and ketchup and dark molasses until well blended. Serve warm or at room temperature. Sauce may be stored in an airtight container in refrigerator for 2-3 weeks or in freezer for up to 6 months.

### Roberto's Pizza

This is by far the best home made pizza I've made. The crust is especially nice.

#### The sauce

Makes 3-4 pizzas

- 32 oz. can crushed plum tomatoes  
- 28 oz. can whole peeled italian plum tomatoes – optional  
- 1 tblsp. olive oil  
- 1 tsp. salt – optional  
- 1 tsp. pepper  
- ⅛ tsp. cayenne pepper  
- 2 tblsp. oregano  
- 3 medium cloves of garlic, crushed  
- 1 tblsp. grated romano cheese

If using peeled tomatoes drain and discard liquid and cut into small pieces. This is for "chicago style" pizza.

Heat all ingredients **except romano cheese** over medium/low heat for 15 minutes and cool to room temperature in refrigerator for 1-2 hours. Add romano cheese. You're done.

#### The dough

Makes 3-4 crusts

- 1 (¼ oz.) package of dry yeast  
- 1 cup luke warm water  
- ½ tsp. salt  
- ¼ cup vegetable oil  
- 8 cups all purpose flour  
- 1 ¾ – 2 cups luke warm water

Mix salt and yeast in a small bowl. Add the first quantity of water (1 cup) to the yeast/salt, **do NOT stir**. Let this stand until the yeast absorbs all the water and floats to the top of the water, approximately 10 minutes. If the yeast does not rise to the top a slight tapping on the bowl will release it from sticking to the bottom of the bowl).

#### Kneading

_Electric Mixer:_ In a large bowl add the flour. Slowly pour the yeast mixture into the center of the flour while the mixer is on knead. Add the oil and gradually add the 2nd mixture of water (1 3/4 – 2 cups) until a thick consistency is attained. Knead dough until smooth. At this point an additional few tablespoons of oil can be added to coat the ball of dough so that it does not stick to the bowl or your hands. Kneading is done when the dough springs back when pulled.

_Hand Kneading:_ In a large bowl add the flour making an indentation in the middle. Pour the yeast mixture into the center of the flour and start with a swirling motion to bring the flour from the edges into the the center. Add oil and water same as with electric mixer and knead until smooth.

#### Let Rise

Form the dough into a ball, cover bowl with a towel wet with warm water and let rise. The dough should about triple in volume in about 2-3 hours. To reduce rising time, heat the oven to its lowest setting and turn off. Put the covered bowl in the oven for about 1 hour.

After rising tear the dough into smaller pieces (about 1 ½ lbs. each). There should be enough for 3 or 4 pieces. From each piece into a ball by folding the dough under. 

#### Form crust

Stretch the dough out from the center and finish stretching with a rolling pin to cover a cookie/pizza sheet. Place dough on cookie/pizza sheet. Turn the excess dough under around the perimeter to form the outer crust. Let the dough rise on the pan for an additional 20 minutes. Pierce with a fork all over.

Preheat oven to 525 degrees. Pre-cook dough for 10 minutes.

Remove from oven, add sauce and toppings. Return to oven and cook to order.

#### Storage

Put the unused balls of dough in individual plastic bags for refrigerator storage. Note: the balls of dough will continue to rise while in the refrigerator so don't use an airtight bag. The dough will keep in the refrigerator for about a week. Freezing is not recommended.

### Bon Appetit

These are two fantastic recipes. I have a few more that are indispensable as well. I can post those as well if desired.
