Our slave laboâ€¦ er, intern, hard at work. Nothing special about it. I was just looking for an excuse to play with the [Reel Moments](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/reelmoments/id331259893?mt=8) app on the iPhone. I've had the app for a while but was hamstrung by a Google phone lock policy that came down with using their Exchange access to the Google Apps. That has now been lifted and I can use the App.

Once my [Glif iPhone Stand](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/danprovost/glif-iphone-4-tripod-mount-and-stand) gets here I can venture out a bit more and do some more fun locations.
