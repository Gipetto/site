Think about it, everybody wants thier own playground, someplace they can put funny or even stupid things and not have it completetly associated with official business.

Hence I registered [fuzzycoconut](http://fuzzycoconut.com). I just couldn't resist it on the name alone – it's just too funny.

The domain might get used later if a collaborative project comes together (which it looks like it is going to – damn exciting!) but for now it is a placeholder for being goofy.

Now, to think of something goofy.
