Ran across a funny bug in the OS X 10.4 Finder this morning involving minimizing Windows to the dock.

As we all know a double click in the title bar will minimize a Finder window to the dock. Well, this morning I was screwing around and triple clicked the title bar. The window minimized and jumped right back out.

So far I've only found it to work with Finder windows.

I have no idea what is going on behind the scenes, but it is nice and mesmerizing.

For reference, I'm on 10.4.8 on a PB 1.67Ghz and probably the last person to find thisâ€¦
