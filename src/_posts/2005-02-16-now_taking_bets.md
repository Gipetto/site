So, today Microsoft announced a new version of Internet Explorer is on the horizon: [IE7](http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2005/02/15/373104.aspx). They say they've listened to their customers and are respoding to a great deal of end user input when putting together this update.

I get the feeling that they're gonna put in a bunch of security and Windows integration options and not touch the rendering bugs that have plagued the browser for years. 

So, here, I'm officially taking bets on what level of standards compliancy we'll see in the new version of IE7. Will it fix rendering bugs? Will it fill out compliance with the CSS 2 specification? Will it properly handle XHTML & XML?

Only time will tell I guess.
