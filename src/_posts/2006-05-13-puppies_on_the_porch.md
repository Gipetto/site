Its getting so nice out here in the evenings we can just spend some time enjoying doing nothing. And, of course, I can have the camera handyâ€¦

I've been struggling creatively lately so I figured 2 things can help. Just pick up the camera and use it, no matter what for, and just shoot everyday things to get rolling. Its working so far. I'm starting to get back into feeling like myself again.
