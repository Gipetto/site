Its that time of year again. Blood, bites, and Zombies.

Downtown Denver turned in to a Zombie infection zone last night as thousands of revelers showed up to have a bloody good time. For whatever reason this year's crawl started during the day and as a result produced a little more of a jovial crowd than last year. But that didn't stop the flow of disturbing scenesâ€¦ oh no.

This year did feel a bit more &#8220;family friendly&#8221; as there were a lot more kids. Not that I'm complaining, but that also seemed to effect everybody's mood a bit. Less smiling and more biting, dammit!
