I haven't been playing a lot of video games lately, the last one that I got through was Portal and I left Half Life 2 and Bioshock each halfway through, but this one's gonna change that. I need to play a little bit before it hits so I don't come off as some lil' bitch n00b when we all get in to co-op and multi-player. 

#### And here's the "butâ€¦"

With the new job I've been working a lot (not tirelessly, but admirably) and just overall I've been feeling a bit flat for a while so there's just a whole lot that hasn't gotten done. It could have something to do with the new job dealing almost exclusively in WordPress and this being, really, my first exposure to WordPress. I'm literally the kid in the candy store and the guy sinking in quicksand at the same time. So much I can do, but so much to learn at the same time.

That has taken its toll on the home life. Not with my relationship with my wife (though it has been the subject of discussion on several occasions), but just in the amount of stuff around the house that I'm not getting done. I'm brain-dead by the time I get home.

I'm gonna have to pick up my shit all around to make time to play. That is, if I can get all my other shit that I need, and say that I'm going, to do. Don't get me wrong, I'm not feeling sorry for myself here, I just know what I have to do, I just can't get it done.

So, uh, where did I put that free time? I could use a little motivation to go along with it. ðŸ˜‰
