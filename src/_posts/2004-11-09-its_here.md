Halo 2 is sitting in my bag as I wait for these last agonizing moments of the day to pass.

I played a bit of it earlier and I simply can't wait to play more. I've read a bit of the reviews but not much as I want to play it before I let other's reviews taint my opinion – but from what I have seen it is simply spectacular. Gameplay is as fun as the last one, graphics are better, and the grunts still have funny little phrases.

I don't anticipate being very productive at home for the next 3 weeks. Which sucks a bit since I just gave up my hiatus status and took in some freelance work. I'm gonna have to find some time to get work into my Halo schedule.

Here's to dual-weilding fun!
