I heard some whispers around the internet about a fun photography exercise called a Camera Toss. It entails setting the camera at a moderate shutter speed and throwing it up into the air. I saw a few samples and they were fantastic. So much so I had to try it for myself. Attached are six samples of what I ended up with.

While I didn't get the same results as some that I saw I am very pleased and encouraged by the images that I did get. I found that an exposure of 1 second @ F13, ISO 100, to be good.

Now, before you try for yourself, please be careful. There is more to consider than just dropping the camera. The motorized mechanisms for zooming the lenses are pretty delicate and if you land hard on that, even in the palm of your hand, you can potentially damage the camera. I've found with this one, a Nikon Coolpix 4300 (I know, I need to get a real digital SLR) that if I suspect anything has bumped the lens too hard that I can turn the camera off and on and it will right itself. If you suspect you've done anything, turn it off and on right away so it can attempt to realign itself before you try again and potentially whack it again. 

I did most of these indoors and over a bed, so I could get some pretty fun twists on the camera and not worry about having to catch it. And, without further banter, here are some images that I made.

On their own they're nice, but not something I'd hang on my wall or something that could stand alone. But these could easily find their way into web banners and other artwork as background or supplementary images. An easy way to get some different artwork into a design.
