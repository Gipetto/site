In July of last year we moved back to Colorado and in to a new (as in brand new build, nobody else has lived here) home. The home backs up on 800 feet of green space that’ll never be developed. We’ll eventually get some apartment buildings or something like that on the other side, but for now we have a purely natural view from our back deck.

The only houses we can see are to the north, but since we’re right next to the mailboxes and water management, nobody will ever be right next to us.

## Bonus Cows

The land around us, as of now, is still ranch land, so we sometimes get some bovine friends hanging around.

All in all, a pretty great place for us to have landed on our return to CO.
