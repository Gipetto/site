I have some very talented co-workers.

First up: a get well soon card hand-crafted by [Danielle](https://twitter.com/tsunamino). Laser cut and signed by a lot of good folks at work. The rest of you are dead to me! Just kidding ðŸ˜‰

Next: Twilio had a Painting Night at Wednesday Night Dinner last week. Look there, in the upper right. See that thing with a halo and wings?

Lets take a closer look at what [Nora](https://twitter.com/noramckinnell) left me. And artists rendition of good ol' lefty headed to testicle heaven.

I don't think I could have asked for anything better than these two gestures&hellip; They're both just simply fantastic.

Honestly, though, I'm really smitten that all of my co-workers are thinking about my testicles.
