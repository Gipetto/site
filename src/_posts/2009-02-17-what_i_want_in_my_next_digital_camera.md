I want a Pentax K1000 or Canon AE1 but with a digital sensor. That's about it. I want a manual control only camera with a digital sensor. Keep the cost down by keeping out all the fancy dancy features. Here's the basic features I would like to see:

  * Manual Mode 
  * Aperture Priority 
  * Shutter Priority 
  * Custom White Balance 
  * PC flash sync & non-TTL hot shoe 
  * Metal frame 
  * Spot meter 
  * "Nothing special" LCD 
  * _Maybe_ it could support autofocus lenses 

Seriously. I would love this camera. Lightweight, inexpensive, and maybe with a nice retro design.

Canon? Pentax? Please? Those old K Mount and FD lenses are still freakin' great (and I have some!). I'd love to be able to put them to use and get a small and convenient SLR.

C'mon â€“ they'd sell to all us fogey's who remember the good ol' days when you didn't know how well you'd shot until you developed the film.
