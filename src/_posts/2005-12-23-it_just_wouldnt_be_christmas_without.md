A bloody dog fight…

You won't be thanking me for this pic.

{% render "image.html"

  title: "Bear's ear damage, suffered in a fight with his brother. A 1/2 inch tear starts from a puncture wound and extends up to the top of his ear."
%}

More details soon.

**Update:** So, 9 stitches and 1 sedation later bear is home and sleeping it off. He not only had the tear in his ear but had a puncture wound in his face.

Hopefully he learned something from this as it was a fight that he started…
