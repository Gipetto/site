Noticed this little guy building a web outside our front window. I figured I’d see if I could handle a spider up close if there was a pane of glass between us.

I had a much harder time editing this than I did shooting it. Editing it, dealing with it up close and full screen on a large monitor, gave me a bad case of the heebie-jeebies.
