Yeah, another night of shooting in the deep dark recesses that is small concert venues. This one was well worth it, though. The Dum Dum Girl's album &#8220;I will be&#8221; has been keeping me more than entertained since I was introduced to it late last year and seeing them in an intimate place like the Hi-Dive was great.



I did have a little more help for the dark environment this time though. I recently added a 28 f/1.8 to my bag of tricks and it worked out wonderfully. The length is just right and the speed was very welcome in this challenging venue.

The only thing that I didn't like about them was the typical non-moving stage show that is so prevalent in today's lo-fi, sub-pop, whatever-you-call-it scene. I much prefer an active stage, but at least the musical energy was up there. The image above is the only one I managed to get of anyone stepping away from a microphone. It happened a _few_ more times but I didn't get it.

I shot this one without a writer handy so I had to do the writeup myself. Sometimes I wonder how I get away with writing like that&hellip; Most likely its because no money changes hands.
