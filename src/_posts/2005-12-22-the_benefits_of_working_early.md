I'm typically out the door at 6:30 or so in the morning to get to work at 7:15. I like that work schedule as it gets me home by 4:45 or so in the evenings.

One other benefit is the sunrises (which I haven't been taking pictures of â€“ dumbass!). They're wonderful.

I do so love the early work schedule.
